#### ESL Podcast 1011 - Building with Wood and Metal

**woodworking** - the art and skill of making objects from wood

> Jane wants to learn more about woodworking so that she can build simple
musical instruments.

**to refinish** - to give a new, more beautiful surface to a piece of furniture

> This furniture has been painted many times, but I bet the wood is beautiful
underneath. All we have to do is remove the paint and refinish it.

**workshop** - a large room where work is done, especially where things are built

> Bryan is a sculptor, so he converted his garage into a workshop where he can
keep all his materials.

**grain** - the lines and patterns on the surface of a cut piece of wood

> Because there are natural variations in the grain of the wood, each tabletop is
unique.

**hardwood** - heavy, compact (tight) wood from trees with broad (wide) leaves,
often used for construction

> Oak and ash are beautiful, but I think beech is my favorite hardwood.

**plywood** - an inexpensive, but strong board (a flat piece of wood) made by
gluing together layers of wood

> The children are making a tree house out of plywood.

**saw** - a tool with a handle and sharp teeth along one side of a piece of metal
used to cut wood

> In the past, it would take men hours to cut down a large tree with a handheld
saw, but now chainsaws can do the work in just minutes.

**chisel** - a long tool with a handle at one end and a sharp, angled metal piece at
the other end, used to shape wood or stone by cutting away small pieces

> Sometimes the best way to open a can of paint is to use a chisel against the
edge of the lid.

**drill** - an electric tool used to put a hole into a piece of wood or metal, or a wall

> Lyle used a drill to put a small hole in the wall before he tried to insert the
screw.

**metal** - a solid, hard, and shiny material like steel, iron, silver, gold, copper,
brass, and more

> I prefer a metal water bottle over a plastic one.

**grillwork** - metal bars or wires that cross each other to make a flat surface,
either in a grid (lines crossing each other with regular spacing) pattern or in an
artistic design

> This neighborhood has a lot of crime, so many of the windows are covered with
grillwork to prevent people from breaking in.

**metalwork** - the art and skill of making objects from metal

> Did you notice all the metalwork on the car's exterior?

**to weld** - to join two pieces of metal by making them very hot so that they begin
to melt and pushing them together

> The screwdriver broke into two pieces. Can you fix it by welding them back
together?

**to solder** - to join two pieces of metal by melting a soft metal and applying it
over the ends of the two pieces

> Soldering computer circuits is a very delicate job that requires steady hands.

**when all is said and done** - eventually; ultimately; in the end; to make a long
story short

> There are a lot of papers to sign, but when all is said and done, you'll be the
owners of a new home.

**to try (one's) hand at (something)** - to try to do something for the first time,
especially if it is difficult and challenging and one has little or no experience
related to it

> Have you ever tried your hand at sewing?

**fond of** - liking something; attracted to something; thinking that something is
good, worthwhile, interesting, and worth keeping or protecting

> The Carlsons asked us to watch their cat while they were out of town, but we
grew fond of it and now we don't want to give it back to them.
