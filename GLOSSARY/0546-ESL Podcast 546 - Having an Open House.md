#### ESL Podcast 546 - Having an Open House

**real estate agent** - a person whose job is to help other people buy and sell
homes, buildings, and land

> We gave our real estate agent a list of the three most important things we're
looking for in a new home: a short distance to work, three large bedrooms, and a
big backyard for the kids to play in.

**open house** - an event where people can come into a home that is for sale to
walk through it, learn about it, and decide whether they would like to buy it

> They've had an open house every Sunday for the past month, but they haven't
found a buyer yet.

**to look over (one's) shoulder** - to closely watch another person's work; to pay
careful attention to what another person is doing, especially when that person
doesn't want to be watched

> Please stop looking over my shoulder! I work much better when I'm left alone.

**lookie-loo** - a person who wants to see what is happening, especially when he
or she doesn't really need to see it

> Whenever there's an accident, traffic slows down because of all the lookie-loos
who slow down to get a better view as they drive by.

**sign-in sheet** - a piece of paper where every attendee or participant writes his
or her name and/or contact information, so that there is a record of who was
there

> Please put your name, email address, and telephone number on the sign-in
sheet when you come into the conference room.

**stager** - a person whose job is to make a home look its best so that it can be
sold more easily

> The stager took down all their family photographs and hung landscape
paintings instead.

**cosmetic repair** - something that improves the appearance of a house or
building without actually making it stronger or safer

> They spent all their money on cosmetic repairs, fixing the cabinets and painting
the walls, but they really need to fix the roof and the fireplace.

**to de-clutter** - to reduce the number of things that are visible in a room; to put
things away; to clear the surfaces of tables and counters

> This house would look so much better if you de-cluttered it, hiding all the toys,
dishes, magazines, pictures, and other small things.

**landscaping** - the combination of plants, flowers, trees, grass, and rocks used
to make a garden or yard beautiful

> Which city parks have the best landscaping?

**to show up** - to appear; to arrive; to come to a particular event or place

> What time did your parents show up at the house?

**fact sheet** - a piece of paper with detailed information about something

> According to this fact sheet, the museum was built in 1924 and has about 4,000
visitors each day.

**square footage** - the number of square feet in a particular area; the size of a
building or a piece of land

> I hope our next house has less square footage because I'm tired of cleaning so
much space!

**lot** - the land that a building sits on; the land owned by a homeowner or building
owner

> They've decided to buy an empty lot and then build their own home on it.

**addition** - a section of a home or other building that has been added to the
original structure

> They're saving money for an addition because they want two more bedrooms
and an extra bathroom for their growing family.

**permitted** - with all the necessary permits, permission, and documentation;
having followed all the laws, rules, and regulations

> My construction crew only works on permitted projects.

**upgrade** - an improvement in a home, usually replacing an old appliance with a
newer appliance, or installing a very nice and expensive countertop or light
fixtures

> Francine paid extra for all the upgrades, including a marble bathtub and granite
countertops.
