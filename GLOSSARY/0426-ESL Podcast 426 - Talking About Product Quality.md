#### ESL Podcast 426 - Talking About Product Quality

**bare basics** - the simplest version of something; only the things that one needs
and nothing more

> His family didn't have very much money to buy new clothes for school, so he
just got the bare basics: a few T-shirts and a pair of jeans.

**top-of-the-line** - the best possible or the best available; the highest quality; the
fanciest and often the most expensive

> Jeilan bought a top-of-the-line digital camera that cost thousands of dollars.

**cheap** - very inexpensive; poor quality

> My mother asked me: "Why did you buy the expensive brand of cereal when
you could have bought a cheap one for so much less?"

**flimsy** - having poor quality so that it breaks easily; easy to damage

> Yoko's glasses were so flimsy that they broke when she accidentally put her
book on top of them.

**to act up** - to have problems; to create problems; to stop working properly

> Their car is acting up again, so they're going to ask the mechanic to look at it.

**quality** - how well made something is; how well or how poorly something does
what it should do

> Cecilia makes very high-quality cakes as birthday presents for her friends.

**top dollar** - a very high price; very expensive; the most expensive kind of
something

> Evy and Valdo paid top dollar for their big home that has a beautiful view of the
mountains.

**bells and whistles** - the fancy things that a piece of technology or electronics
can do, in addition to the basic things that it should do

> This cell phone has lots of bells and whistles that a regular phone doesn't have,
like an Internet browser, a nice camera, and more.

**sturdy** - strong and reliable; not likely to break; well-built

> Jimena bought a chair that wasn't very sturdy, and it broke the first time she sat
in it!

**that is one (something)** - an expression that gives emphasis, used to show that
the words that follow it are very true

> That is one expensive hamburger! I've never heard of a hamburger that costs
more than $25.

**looks** - physical appearance; the way that something is viewed

> As a teenager, Falia only cared about her looks, even though her parents told
her that what's inside is more important.

**functional** - working; able to work; able to do what something is supposed to do

> They built a beautiful website, but it isn't very functional, so visitors can't find
what they're looking for.

**to fall apart** - to break; to break into many smaller pieces; to stop working
properly

> The children built a small house out of sticks, but it fell apart when the wind
blew too hard.

**style over substance** - something that is very beautiful, but doesn't work well;
something that was made by people who paid more attention to its appearance
than to whether it would do what is was supposed to do

> This new stove is an example of style over substance, because even though it
looks great, it doesn't cook reliably.

**hideous** - very ugly; extremely unattractive

> There is a hideous witch in that movie, with a green face and a huge nose.

**to get over (something)** - to be able to accept that something bad has
happened and continue on with one's normal life, not worrying about it
