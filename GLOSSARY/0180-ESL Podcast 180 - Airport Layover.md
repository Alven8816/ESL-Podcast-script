#### ESL Podcast 180 - Airport Layover

**frequent flyer miles** - points airline companies give to customers who fly on
their airline; customers can use the points to get things such as free airline tickets
or to stay for free at hotels

> Because I flew to Europe so many times last year, I have enough frequent flyer
miles to go to Australia this summer.

**booked** - to purchase; to make a reservation

> Have you booked the room for our weekend in Palm Springs yet?

**layover** - the period of time you must wait between flights when you are
changing from one flight to another

> The layover in New York is just enough time for us to take a break and eat a
real dinner.

**to kill** - to spend or to waste, usually while waiting for something

> I have so much time to kill now that I have finished my work early.

**food court** - an area with several different fast food shops; usually the shops are
around an area with tables and chairs where customers can eat

> At the food court, I usually eat McDonalds and my friend gets Chinese food.

**to check (one's) bags** - to give your luggage to the airline to be put into the
airplane; not luggage you plan to take on the airplane

> The first thing I do at the airport is to check my bags, because I hate carrying
them around while I wait for my flight.

**roller bag** - a suitcase or backpack with wheels on the bottom and a handle on
the top

> I'm so glad I bought a roller bag. Now, I don't need to carry the heavy bag all
over the airport.

**carry on** - hand luggage that is small enough to be taken on an airplane

> Since I'll need my book and my computer on the plane, I put them in my carry
on.

to carry

were taken.

**stuff** - things or objects

> My desk is so messy. There is always so much stuff on it, I can't find anything.

**to keep an eye on** - to watch; to guard

> In soccer, you should keep your eye on the ball so you know where the action
is.

**to take it with (someone)** - to keep something near you

**to save a seat** - to keep the seat free; not let anyone else sit there
