good pair of boots.

**to fit right in** - to be the same as everyone or everything else; to appear to

fit right in.

**alongside** - together with another person; doing something next to or at the
same time as another person

**to look the part** - to appear the way people expect one to appear; to dress and
act as one is expected to dress and act

letting his hair grow long and growing a beard.

**cowboy hat** - a very large hat made from felt (thick, soft fabric), traditionally
worn by men who work outdoors with cows and sheep, used to protect one's face
and eyes from sunlight

> A lot of people wear cowboy hats when they go to country-western dances.

**lasso** - a long rope with a large circle tied at one end that is thrown to fall over
the horns or neck of a cow and then pulled so that the circle becomes smaller
and the animal cannot run away

> When Marty was just learning how to use a lasso, he threw it at objects before
he started trying to throw it at live animals.

**chaps** - a piece of clothing similar to pants and made of leather, worn over one's
pants to protect them while riding a horse

cattle (cows) over a long distance

considering specializing in sheep.

**bridle** - the pieces of leather that are placed over a horse's head and held in the
rider's hands to control where the horse goes

**bit** - the metal bar that is put in a horse's mouth and held between its teeth,
attached to the bridle and used to control how the horse moves

want to have to hold a piece of metal in your mouth?
