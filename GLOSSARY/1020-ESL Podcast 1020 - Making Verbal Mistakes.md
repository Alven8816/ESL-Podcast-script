#### ESL Podcast 1020 - Making Verbal Mistakes

**verbal** - oral; with spoken words, not written words

> The judge asked the witness to provide verbal responses instead of just
nodding or shaking her head.

**to mispronounce** - to say something incorrectly, using the wrong sounds,
especially when saying aloud an unfamiliar word

> It bothers Mr. Schlukebier that people almost always mispronounce his name.

**for one** - for example; for instance; a phrase used when one is stating one of
many possible things

> We have many reasons for wanting to expand, like the potential growth in
profits, for one.

**to stumble over** - to do something poorly, especially when speaking in an
unclear or confusing manner

> Sheila stumbled over her opening remarks, but then she relaxed and appeared
more confident throughout the rest of the presentation.

**delivery** - the way in which one presents information, especially orally

> When people use too many hand gestures, it can be a distraction from the rest
of their delivery.

**to put it lightly** - to state something more mildly, gently, or kindly than one
could; to understate something

> Ahmed said his garage was disorganized, but that was putting it lightly. It's a
complete mess!

**to stutter** - to involuntarily and uncontrollably repeat the first sound of words
many times, making it difficult to communicate

> Melanie often stutters when she gets nervous, so she's seeing a speech
therapist for help.

**verbiage** - words that are spoken or printed, especially when the words are
verbose (using too many words) or technical

> The editor is helping us reduce the verbiage to fit everything on one page.

**tongue twister** - a phrase or poem that is difficult to say, usually because the
words have similar sounds

> One of Harold's favorite tongue twisters is "She sells seashells on the
seashore."

**to have (something) down cold** - to understand something very well, be very
familiar with it, and/or have something memorized perfectly

> Jasnery has practiced her acceptance speech more than 100 times, so she has
it down cold.

**slip of the tongue** - a misstatement; an instance in which one accidentally says
the wrong thing or says something incorrectly

> I can't believe I called him by the wrong name during an interview. What a
horrible time for a slip of the tongue!

**Freudian slip** - a mistake while speaking that shows what one was really
thinking about, especially if it's sexual

> Instead of saying, "I'm so glad to see you," she said, "I'm so mad to see you." I
guess that was a Freudian slip.
**(one's) bread and butter** - the way one earns a living; the main part of one's
business; the main way in which one makes money

> Sometimes he sells paintings, but selling insurance policies are his bread and
butter.

**flub** - a minor mistake or error, especially while speaking

> That number seems way too high. Maybe it was just a flub in her presentation
**(one's) mind was elsewhere** - a phrase meaning that someone was distracted
and was thinking about something else, or that one was not focused on and
paying attention to something

> The student's mind was elsewhere, so he wasn't prepared to answer the
teacher's question when she called on him.

**blooper reel** - a short, funny video that shows the mistakes people made while a
movie or TV show was being filmed

> The blooper reel shows a kissing scene that was interrupted when the car
alarm started going off.

**outtake** - segments of video that were filmed, but were not included in the final
product

> Lisa was really disappointed when her only speaking lines in the movie became
part of the outtakes.

**footage** - recorded video for a movie or TV show

> Detectives are analyzing footage from security cameras to try to identify the
bank robber.
