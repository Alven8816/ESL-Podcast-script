#### ESL Podcast 549 - Using a Camera

**camera** - a device used to take photographs of images, people, or scenes

> I'm not a professional photographer, so I don't need an expensive camera. Just
a simple camera is good enough for me.

**photography** - the art and science of taking good photographs

> The college offers several photography courses that teach students about the
importance of good lighting.

**digital camera** - a type of camera that is electronic and saves photographs as
electronic computer files so that they can be changed, printed, or deleted

> The great thing about digital cameras is that we can delete all the unattractive
photos and pretend they never even existed!

**auto** - automatic; related to something that happens without anyone needing to
do anything to make it happen

> Shitari set up an auto response in her email account, letting people know that
she'll be out of the office until Monday.

**zoom** - the ability to change the view so that something seems to be either very
close or very far away

> They love bird watching and use binoculars so that they can zoom in and see
the birds in more detail.

**image stabilization** - a camera's ability to keep an image in focus (very clear)
even if the camera is moving in a person's hands

> Juan Carlos's hands always shake, but because his camera has image
stabilization, it isn't a problem when he takes photos.

**memory card** - a small, usually rectangular piece of electronic equipment that is
used to store data, especially for cameras and phones, and that can be used on
different devices and computers

> This memory card is full, because we've taken more than 200 pictures. Do you
have an empty memory card we can use?

**point-and-shoot** - a simple kind of camera where one can simply hold it up
facing the thing that one wants to take a photograph of, and push a button to take
the photo, without needing to change any settings

> Point-and-shoot cameras are good for simple photographs while you're on
vacation, but if you want to have really high-quality photos, you'll need to buy a
better camera.

**viewer** - the small rectangular opening in the back of a camera that one looks
through with one eye while taking a photo to see the image that will appear in the
photograph

> Use the camera's viewer to make sure that none of our relatives are left out of
the photo.

**flash** - a bright light that lasts for a very short period of time, used to provide
extra lighting when one is taking a photo with a camera

> We were temporarily blinded by the flash of the camera and couldn't see
anything for a few seconds after Amir took our photo.

**shutter speed** - the amount of time that a small window inside the camera is
open, so that a slower shutter speed means more light exposure and a faster
shutter speed means less light exposure

> When you want to take a picture of something that's moving very quickly, like a
car, you need to use a fast shutter speed.

**lens** - the glass or plastic part of the camera that light travels through

> If the camera lens is dirty, please clean it before you take a photo.

**wide-angle** - a type of camera lens that creates photographs with a wider-than-
normal view

> Leta likes to use a wide-angle lens to take photos of nature scenes.

**close-up** - very near to something; with very little distance between oneself and
another person or thing, especially when talking about a photo or a video

> They're trying to take a close-up photo of their baby's face while she's laughing.

**to delete** - to erase, remove, or permanently get rid of something

> Why did you delete the voicemail message before I had a chance to listen to it?

**born yesterday** - naÃ¯ve and inexperienced; easily tricked or lied to

> Of course I know how to use a fax machine. I wasn't born yesterday.

**to load** - to put something into something else, especially when it is needed to
make something work

> Don't forget to load the gun with bullets before you go hunting.

**film** - a very long, thin piece of plastic used to record photographic images in
traditional cameras

> If you open your camera before the roll of film is finished, you'll expose the film
to light and ruin all the photos you've taken.
