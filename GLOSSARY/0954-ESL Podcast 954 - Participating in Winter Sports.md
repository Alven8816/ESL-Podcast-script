#### ESL Podcast 954 - Participating in Winter Sports

**to snow** - for small, soft ice crystals to fall from the sky, usually sticking together

> If the weather gets a little colder tonight, it might snow. Otherwise, it will rain.

**sled** - several pieces of wood attached to a metal frame, used to sit or lie down
on top of as one slides down a ramp or hill covered with snow

> Be careful the sled doesn't crash into a tree!

**downhill skiing** - the sport and recreational activity of sliding down a mountain
with skis (long, flat, narrow pieces) attached to one's shoes, usually at a very fast
speed

> Before you go downhill skiing, you'll need to buy warm clothing, a waterproof
jacket, a hat, gloves, and goggles.

**powder** - snow that has recently fallen and is still dry and loose, not yet
compacted (pressed together)

> This powder is great for skiing, but not for making snowballs.

**to careen** - to move without control at a very high speed toward a specific palce,
especially in a vehicle

> The driver ignored the speed limit and careened down the dangerous cliff.

**bunny slope** - a low hill covered with snow, used by people who are just
beginning to ski or snowboard so that they can practice on the easiest paths
without going very quickly

> Most children stay on the bunny slopes, but Craig was on some of the
mountain's hardest trails by the time he was nine years old.

**snowmobile** - a motorized vehicle that one or more people sit on top of, similar
to a motorcycle, but with ski-like pieces instead of wheels

> In the wintertime, we use snowmobiles to get to the more distant fields.

**cross-country skiing** - the sport and recreational activity of moving over snow
with skis (long, flat, narrow pieces) attached to one's shoes, usually slowly over
relatively flat surfaces

> Cross-country skiing offers a great workout, because it's a lot of work to glide
over the snow!

**ice skate** - to move over a flat surface of ice while wearing special shoes with a
single blade on each foot

> I used to dream of doing jumps and spins while ice skating, but at this point, I'd
be happy if I could just go in a straight line without falling down!

**to get the hang of (something)** - to become good at something; to learn to do
something that is difficult or tricky

> If you keep practicing every night, you'll get the hang of knitting in no time.

**to snowboard** - to slide downhill over snow with one's feet attached to a flat,
oval-shaped board like a skateboard without wheels, often while jumping and
performing special tricks

> Snowboarding is very popular with young people, while older people tend to
prefer skiing.

**to blow smoke** - to exaggerate; to say something that isn't true while trying to
make one appear better than one actually is

> Min says he can speak five languages fluently, but I think he's blowing smoke.

**to have the nerve** - to be very bold in doing something that is rude, arrogant, or
inappropriate

> I can't believe she had the nerve to criticize the way you dress, considering that
she wears shorts and flip-flops to the office.

**ice hockey** - a game played by two teams on the ice, trying to get the puck (a
small disc) into a net at either end of the ice rink, similar to soccer

> Which sport is more violent: American football or ice hockey?

**make it** - a phrase used when one is making a suggestion, especially changing
what another person has just proposed

> A: Let's go get some hamburgers.
B: Make it pizza, and I'll be ready to go in two minutes.

**snowball fight** - a playful game where people throw balls of snow at each other,
usually without really trying to hurt the other person and without keeping score

> It hardly ever snows here, but when it does, the college students go to the main
lawn and have a huge snowball fight.

**you're on** - a phrase used to show that one agrees to and accepts what another
person has proposed, especially when it is a challenge or an opportunity to
compete

> When Brandon proposed a 3-mile race, Sheila smiled and said, "You're on!"
