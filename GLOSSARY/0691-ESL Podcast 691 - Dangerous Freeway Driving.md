#### ESL Podcast 691 - Dangerous Freeway Driving

**each way** - in both directions; going somewhere and coming back; both halves
of a round-trip

> Kyoko's commute is 45 minutes each way.

**to get old** - to become tiresome, boring, monotonous, and uninteresting

> Laura doesn't like working as a customer service representative. She says that
listening to people complain all the time gets old.

**interminable** - very long, uninteresting, and boring

> Doesn't Professor Faber notice that almost half of the students fall asleep
during her interminable lectures?

**to pass** - to move around another car when driving, usually because one wants
to go faster than that car

> Trent drives 50 miles per hour on the freeway, so of course most other drivers
try to pass him.

**passing lane** - the parallel area on the left-hand side of the road, separated by
painted lines, intended to be used by the fastest cars that want to move around
slower cars, which should travel in the other parallel areas on the middle and
right-hand side of the road

> Can you get a ticket for driving too slowly in the passing lane?

**to tailgate** - to follow another moving car very closely, leaving dangerously little
space between the two cars

> Please stop tailgating the car in front of us! If the other driver slows down, you
won't be able to brake quickly enough and we'll get in an accident!

**to weave** - to change direction many times while moving, especially while driving
and changing lanes frequently

> Asu likes to ride a motorcycle because he can weave through heavy traffic
more easily than he can in a car.

**back and forth** - repeatedly going in one direction and then in the opposite
direction

> Look how everyone is swaying back and forth to the music.

**what can I say** - an informal phrase used when one is admitting that one's
actions are slightly bad or inappropriate, but one does not want to change that
behavior

> I know smoking is bad for me, but what can I say? It helps me relax.

**to keep (someone) from** - to prevent someone from having or doing something;
to not allow someone to have or do something

> How long are you going to try to keep your daughter from dating?

**open road** - the feeling of freedom one has when driving in an area with little
traffic

> Troy can't wait to get his driver's license so he can start to explore the open
road.

**to encounter** - to find or meet someone without planning to do so

> As a teacher, do you find it uncomfortable when encountering your students
outside of school, like in a grocery store?

**drag race** - an informal competition to see which car can go faster when both
cars are stopped at the beginning of the race, often at a stoplight

> This car accelerates really quickly, so I'm sure it could win a drag race.

**to bird dog** - to observe, watch, or monitor something very carefully

> Police officers have been bird dogging the suspect for weeks.

**to speed up** - to accelerate; to go faster; to do something more quickly; to
increase in speed

> They asked the taxi driver to speed up because they were worried they might
miss their flight.

**to overtake** - to pass; to go past another car or person because one wants to go
faster

> It's very dangerous to overtake another car on a curve because you can't see
whether other cars are coming from the other direction.

**to spice up** - to make something more interesting and exciting

> Let's spice up this party by putting on some dance music.

**on the road** - while traveling, especially by car

> I'll be on the road next week, but you can reach me on my cell phone.
