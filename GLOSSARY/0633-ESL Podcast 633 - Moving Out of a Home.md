#### ESL Podcast 633 - Moving Out of a Home

home so that one can begin living there

> Don't forget to call the electricity and gas companies to set up your accounts
before you move into the new apartment.

**to move out** - to stop living in a place; to move all of one's belongings out of a
home so that one can go somewhere else to live

> Quincy is really excited about moving out of his parents' home to go to college.

**last-minute packing** - the process of putting things in boxes immediately before
one is leaving, often because one has waited too long

> Ermin hates the stress of last-minute packing, so he usually has everything
ready at least four days before he goes on a trip.

close cardboard boxes by taping together the sides of the tops and bottoms

> You can buy boxes and packing tape at the post office if you need to send a
package.

**major undertaking** - a large and/or difficult task or project that requires a lot of
planning and work

> Painting the exterior of a three-story home is a major undertaking. Why don't
you hire someone else to do it, instead of trying to do it yourself?

**mover** - a person whose job is to help people pack their belongings, put them
into a large truck, drive them to a new location, and then take them out of the
truck and into the new building, possibly unpacking the belongings, too

> Write "bedroom," "bathroom," or "kitchen" on each box, so the movers know
where to put them.

**moving van** - a large truck used to carry furniture and boxes from one
apartment, home, or office to another

> If you have a one-bedroom apartment, a 10-foot moving van is probably big
enough, but if you have a five-bedroom home, you might need a 27-foot moving
van.

**storage** - facilities where one can keep one's belongings until they are needed

> They're moving out of their home on the 7th
, but their new home won't be ready
until the 30th
, so they have to put all their things in storage for a few weeks.

a short period of time

> When Ken moved overseas, he left all his perishables with his neighbor, like
milk, eggs, bread, mayonnaise, and other groceries.

**essentials** - things that one must have and cannot live without

> It's just an overnight trip, so I packed only the essentials: clean underwear, a
toothbrush, and a comb.

**to lift** - to raise heavy things off the ground or another surface, usually so they
can be taken somewhere else

> If you need to lift heavy boxes, use your knees, not your back.

quick and easy.

works?

receiving some benefit

for fun or for a social event

and take a deep breath, and it'll be done in no time.
