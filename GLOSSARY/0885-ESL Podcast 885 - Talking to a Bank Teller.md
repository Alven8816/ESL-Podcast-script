#### ESL Podcast 885 - Talking to a Bank Teller

**to deposit** - to put money into a bank account for savings or for later use

> Helena deposits 30% of her paycheck into savings and puts the rest of it in her
checking account.

**check** - a small piece of paper that transfers money from one bank account to
an individual or business

> We accept cash, check, or credit card payments.

**deposit slip** - a small piece of paper that lists the cash and checks one is
putting into a bank account

> Sir, your deposit slip indicates that you're depositing $460 in cash, but I see
only $440.

**to endorse** - to sign the back of a check so that a bank employee can confirm
that one is the same person whose name is written on the front of the check

> Please endorse the check and then present your ID so that we can check the
signature.

**to cash** - to receive cash (paper money and coins) in exchange for a check

> I'd like to cash this check for $40. Could I please have a $20, a $10, and two $5
bills?

**receipt** - a small piece of paper that summarizes a purchase or a financial
transaction

> The receipt shows that I purchased three boxes of cereal, but I bought only two.
Could you please refund the difference?

**to count out** - to say the amount of money one is placing into another person's
hand, increasing the number each time one places another bill

> Please don't count out the money so loudly. I don't want the other people
standing in line to know how much money I'll be carrying.

**bank balance** - the amount of money currently in one's bank account, as
recorded by the bank

> The bank balance shows we have several hundred dollars, but that's just
because our rent check hasn't been deducted yet.

**to swipe** - to move a debit or credit card through the narrow opening in a
machine so that it can be read electronically

> Please swipe your credit card with the front facing toward the right.

**ATM card** - a debit card; a card (like a credit card) that allows one to take money
from one's bank account by using an ATM (automated teller machine)

> Every time you use your ATM card, the bank charges a $2 fee.

**to enter** - to type information into a computer or other electronic machine

> Please enter the sales figures for last month.

**PIN** - personal identification number; a four-digit number that, when used in
combination with a debit or credit card, gives one access to money and personal
financial information

> Your PIN should be easy for you to remember, but don't use something like
your birth year, which would be too easy for other people to guess.

**to withdraw** - to take money out of an account

> In an emergency, we can withdraw funds from our retirement savings to help
with medical expenses.

**withdrawal slip** - a small piece of paper that one presents to a bank employee
to take money out of one's bank account

> Please write your account number of this withdrawal slip or, if you don't know it,
we can look it up on our computer.

**window** - one of many openings, kind of like a small office, in the lobby of a
bank or other business, where one customer and one employee can interact at
the same time

> These windows are built with bulletproof glass to protect bank employees in
case of a robbery.

**to transfer** - to move money from one account to another

> Can I set up an automatic transfer of $150 from my checking account to my
savings account every two weeks?

**to take awhile** - to last a long time; for something to need a lot of time to happen

> Wow, this report is more than 1,000 pages long! Reading it could take a while.
