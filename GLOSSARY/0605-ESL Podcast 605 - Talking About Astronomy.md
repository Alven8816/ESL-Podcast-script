**Earth** - the planet that humans live on

**universe** - the entire world, including all planets, stars, suns, moons, galaxies,
and the space between them

Earth, including all other planets, stars, suns, moons, galaxies, and more

**planet** - a very big, round object like Earth, Mars, or Venus that moves around a
sun

> When I was a kid, we were taught that Mars, Venus, Earth, Mercury, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were the only planets in our solar system,
but it seems like scientists have discovered many other planets since then.

**solar system** - the part of outer space that we are most familiar with, including
the Sun and the planets that move around it

> How long would it take a spaceship to travel outside of our solar system?

**Big Bang** - Big Bang theory; the idea that everything in the universe was
created with one large explosion and that small pieces are still moving away from

> Do you think that the Big Bang theory can account for life on Earth?

**light years** - the distance traveled by light in one year

> How many light years would be needed to travel to Saturn?

**star** - one of many small points of light in the nighttime sky, actually a very large
