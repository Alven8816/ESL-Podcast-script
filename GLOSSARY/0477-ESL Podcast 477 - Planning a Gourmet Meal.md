#### ESL Podcast 477 - Planning a Gourmet Meal

**food critic** - a person whose job is to taste food, especially at restaurants, and
then write about it, often for a newspaper or magazine, letting other people know
whether they should try it too

> I read an article by a food critic who said the restaurant was fantastic, but when
I went there, I didn't think the food was very good at all.

**gourmet** - very good food made with the best ingredients and cooking
techniques

> Tomas makes gourmet desserts, using only the best and most expensive
chocolate.

**mind-blowing** - amazing and surprising; beyond expectations; difficult to believe
or understand

> The professor gave a mind-blowing lecture. I had no idea computer networks
could be so interesting!

**cuisine** - a type of food, especially if it's from a particular geographic region

> Do you prefer Thai or Indian cuisine?

**you're only as good as your last (something)** - a phrase used to show that it
doesn't matter how many times one does something well, because other people
will remember only the most recent one

> Remember that you're only as good as your last performance, so go on stage
and sing as well as you can for each audience.

**delicacy** - a food that is delicious and not very common, often because it is very
expensive and difficult to make

> In some countries, frog legs are a delicacy.

**hors d'oeuvre** - an appetizer; a small amount of food that is served and eaten
before the main meal

> We ate some delicious crab hors d'oeuvres while we were waiting for our food
to be served.

**chef** - a person whose job is to cook in a restaurant

> The food at that restaurant has gotten a lot better since they hired a new chef.

**entrée** - the main course; the main part of a meal

> I ordered spaghetti for the entrée and ice cream for dessert.

**to put all of (one's) eggs in one basket** - to put all of one's efforts, energy,
money, or time into a single project or task, so that if it fails, one fails, but if it is
successful, one succeeds

> I know you've been working really hard on the Acme project, but don't put all
your eggs in one basket. It would be safer to work on several other projects at
the same time, just in case the Acme project fails.

**course** - one part of a meal, such as an appetizer, a soup or salad, an entrée, or
a dessert

> The main course was lasagna, followed by a delicious tiramisu dessert.

**out of this world** - very good; unbelievably good

> Have you ever listened to their music? That band is out of this world!

**run-of-the -mill** - ordinary, normal, and not very interesting; just like every other
thing; not unique; boring

> He paid a lot of money to go to the conference, so he was disappointed that it
was just another run-of-the-mill event where he didn't really learn anything new.

**mediocre** - average; not special or good

> Chuck was always a mediocre student, earning Bs and Cs.

**mouthwatering** - making one very hungry because something is delicious;
making one want to eat something

> When they walked into the kitchen, they commented on the mouthwatering
smell of dinner cooking.

**delectable** - delicious; very pleasant

> That was a delectable soup. Could you please give me the recipe so that I can
make it at home?

**taste buds** - the very small spots on one's tongue that let one sense flavors like
sweet, salty, bitter, and sour

> Doctors say that we lose our taste buds as we get older, and that's why many
old people don't enjoy their food as much as they did when they were younger.
