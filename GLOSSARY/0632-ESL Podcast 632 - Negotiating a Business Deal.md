#### ESL Podcast 632 - Negotiating a Business Deal

**negotiation** - the process of trying to reach an agreement with another person
or organization where each side is willing to give up a little bit of something to
meet the other side's needs

> They found a house they'd like to buy, but now they're in negotiations over who
will pay for the new roof.

**deal** - an agreement, especially involving a sale or exchange of goods or
services

> Did you get a good deal on the new car?

**to put the finishing touches on (something)** - to make the last small
adjustments or changes to finish something well, when most of the work has
already been done

> They've almost finished remodeling their kitchen, and now they're just putting
the finishing touches on it by painting the walls and changing the handles on the
cupboards.

**to hold out** - to delay agreeing to something because one is waiting until one
receives something else

> We're almost ready to accept their offer, but we're still holding out for a little
more money.

**concession** - something that one agrees to let another person have or do in
order to reach an agreement or end an argument

> The company can be flexible with your vacation time, but we simply cannot
make concessions on salary.

**demand** - something that one insists on having; something that one says one
must have or do in order for something else to happen

> They'll never agree to your demands for such a large expense account.

**to give in** - to agree to do something that another person wants, even though
one doesn't really want to; to let another person win

> If we're persistent, at some point they'll give in just because they're tired of
arguing with us.

**to counter** - to make a proposal in response to another person's proposal

> Randy initially offered just $200 for our boat, but we countered with $300.

**to have (someone) over a barrel** - to be in a situation where someone is in a
very difficult, uncomfortable, or impossible situation and one can take advantage
of that, knowing that one will win

> The landlord raised the rent again and the apartment is too expensive for us
now, but he has us over a barrel, because we don't have anywhere else to go.

**to walk away** - to end discussions and stop negotiations because one is no
longer interested in something, usually because the other side is asking for too
much

> Don't be too greedy! If you keep asking for more and more, they might just
walk away and leave you with nothing.

**at the table** - in discussions; continuing to participate in negotiations

> They spent many hours at the table before they agreed on the terms of the
merger.

**to cave** - to give in; to give up; to agree to the other side's demands just to reach
an agreement, usually because one is tired of arguing or negotiating

> The Jamisons were so desperate to find renters for their home that they caved
and agreed to let the new tenants have pets in the home, even though they really
don't like the idea.

**touch-and-go** - fragile and hesitant; something that could fall apart or fail at any
moment

> The business is touch-and-go right now, and if the economy doesn't improve, it
will probably have to close.

**to characterize (something)** - to describe something in a particular way

> How would you characterize the play? Is it a comedy or a tragedy?

**duly noted** - a phrase used to show that one has heard and understood what
another person has said and will think about it, especially when one needs to
make a decision

> Your complaints have been duly noted and we will share them with the store
manager.
