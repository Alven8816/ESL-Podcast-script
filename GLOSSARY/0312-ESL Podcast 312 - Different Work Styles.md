do; the ability and willingness to fulfill one's promises; the ability and willingness
to continue working on something until it is finished

> Franka has many good ideas, but her follow-through is terrible, so nothing ever
happens.

difficult to teach an older person to do something differently, or that it is difficult to
get an adult to change his or her habits
