#### ESL Podcast 520 - Getting Directions and Parking Instructions

**directions** - instructions about how to go somewhere, especially when driving

> When we mail out the party invitations, should we include directions to our
house?

**cross street** - the closest street that touches the street where one's home or
office is

> The pharmacy is at 5839 Main Street, and the nearest cross street is Division
Avenue.

**exit** - a road that lets cars leave a freeway or highway, slowly decreasing their
speed before they go onto slower-moving roads

**to head** - to go in a particular direction; to travel in a specific direction

> They left town about two hours ago, heading south.

**bend** - a curve in the road; a part of the road that lets one change direction
without stopping first

> Our house is just past the third bend in the road.

**to veer** - to change direction without stopping; to move toward the right or left
from a main road

> Go through the intersection and then veer to the left to get to the museum.

**dead end** - a street that ends with no other connecting streets, so that a car has
nowhere to go and must turn around

> Many people want to live on a dead end because there's less traffic, and it's
safer for kids to play near the street.

**one-way street** - a street where all the cars must move in the same direction

> You can't turn right here because it's a one-way street. You need to go up to
the next street and turn right there instead.

**light** - traffic light; a box that hangs over the street with three lights: red, yellow,
and green to control traffic

> Even though we were in a hurry, we had to stop because the light was red.

**street parking** - the act of parking on the edge of a street, between the moving
cars and the sidewalk

> It's almost impossible to find street parking in this part of downtown Los
Angeles.

**valet parking** - the act of stopping one's car in front of a business and giving
one's keys to a person (valet) who then drives the car away and parks it, bringing
it back when one is ready to leave

> The city's most expensive restaurants offer valet parking for their customers.

**to validate** - for a business to put a mark on a piece of paper, showing that it will
pay for a customer to park in a specific location

> The store validates up to one hour of parking for anyone who makes a
purchase.

**meter** - a machine next to a street that one can put coins (metal pieces of
money) into to buy a certain amount of time when one will be allowed to park in a
particular spot

> Did you put enough coins into the meter? We're going to be inside for at least
50 minutes.

**side street** - a street that is connected to the main street, but has less traffic and
is less important

> Rent for stores is less expensive on side streets than on the main street.

**to circle the block** - to go around a group of buildings by making three right
turns or three left turns

> They couldn't find a parking spot, so he circled the block slowly while she was
inside the store, making her purchase.

something

> You can count on me to help you clean up after the conference. I won't forget.
