it

they are interesting, beautiful, or valuable

> My grandfather had a large stamp collection, with stamps from almost every
country in the world.

**DVD - digital video disk** - a flat disk (circular object) similar to a CD, made of
metal and plastic that is used to store digital information or video

> In the early 1990s, people were using video cassettes, but today DVDs are
much more popular for movies.

**on the big screen** - in a movie theater, not on a TV at home

> The Lord of the Rings is a movie with a lot of action, so it's better to see it on
the big screen than on TV.

**high definition** - high resolution; high video quality; clear and easy to see on a
TV or computer screen

> You can see a lot of more detail on a high definition TV than on a regular TV.

**widescreen edition** - a version of a movie or show where the picture is much
wider than it is tall, so that a black bar shows at the top and bottom of the TV
screen, but all the images can be seen

> If you don't watch the widescreen edition, sometimes you can't see all of the
things happening in a movie, because images get cut off on the sides of the
screen.

**bonus feature** - an extra thing that is related to a movie and included on a DVD,
but not part of the original movie, such as comments from the director or
information about how the movie was made

> This DVD has a bonus feature where the director speaks throughout the movie,
talking about why he filmed it the way he did.

**to pride (oneself) on (something)** - to be proud of something that one does; to
be very pleased that one does something

> Drake prides himself on being the fastest runner on his high school track team.

**Easter egg** - an unusual message, image, or sound that is hidden in a movie,
book, painting, computer program, or video game as a joke, so that people
search for it

> If you search long enough, you may find the Easter egg on this DVD with the
very funny video of star of the movie.

**special edition** - a version of something that is available for only a short period
of time and has extra features that aren't included in the regular version

color than the original movie did, and it has information about how the film was
made.

**box set** - a box with special packaging that has all the DVDs in a series

> We bought Carolyn the box set of Friends for her birthday because it's her
favorite TV show.

**blooper** - a funny mistake that was made while filming a movie or TV show,
usually when an actor laughs, forgets what to say, or falls down

> Sometimes the bloopers on a comedy DVD are funnier than the movie itself!

**deleted scene** - acting that was originally supposed to be in the movie, but was
taken out before the movie was finished, often to make it shorter

> Deleted scenes are interesting to watch because they can help you understand
how the director decides what is and isn't important in a movie.

**region code** - one of nine electronic codes hidden in a DVD that allows the DVD
to be seen only in some parts of the world

> If you buy a DVD in Malaysia and take it to the United States, you won't be able
to watch it because it will have the wrong region code.

**bootleg** - pirated; an illegal copy of something that was made without giving any
money to the people who made the original

> Bootleg CDs are cheaper than CDs that you buy in a store, but the singers and
bands don't get any money for their work.
