#### ESL Podcast 984 - Competing in Business

**the only game in town** - the only person or organization involved in a particular
business or field, without any competitors

> Our restaurant used to be the only game in town, but in the past four years,
more than 10 other Italian restaurants have opened.

**competitor** - a business that offers similar products and services to similar
customers, so that two companies are trying to sell to the same customers

> How can we prevent our competitors from copying everything we do?

**to lure away** - to attract someone away from another person or business

> Aren't you worried that Sean's attractive new receptionist will lure him away
from you?

**to go under** - to go broke; to become bankrupt; to become unprofitable and
have to close a business

> The bad weather has made a lot of orange growers go under.

**price matching** - the practice of selling one's product for the same price that
other companies are selling it for

> This store has a great price matching policy, so if you see another store
advertising that it will sell something for less, they'll adjust the price.

**competitive** - with similar characteristics and qualifications, making something
equally attractive

> You'll need to have at least a master's degree if you want to be competitive in
this job market.

**to undercut** - to sell something at a lower price than one's competitor

> We're already selling these gadgets for less than the cost of manufacturing
them. How could anyone undercut us?

**to slash prices** - to reduce prices very quickly by a very large amount; to lower
the price of something a great deal

> The furniture store is slashing prices to reduce inventory before the start of the
next year.

**profit margin** - the difference between the sales price and the cost of producing
that good or service; the net proceeds from a sale

> We can increase our profit margin by raising the sales price or reducing the
manufacturing cost.

**desperate times** - periods of time that are very difficult or challenging and leave
one with few options, requiring people to do things they might not normally do

> These are desperate times for many homeowners who are forced to sell their
home for less than they bought it for.

**two-for-one deal** - an arrangement where customers buy one item and get a
second item for free as an incentive to buy more than they normally would

> The drugstore is offering a great two-for-one deal on makeup this week.

**for a limited time** - temporarily; not permanently; not forever; with a defined
amount of time

> For a limited time, the car dealership is offering three years of oil changes and
other car maintenance with any new car purchase.

**freebie** - something that is given to someone at no cost, especially to encourage
that person to come into a store and buy something while he or she is there

> What percentage of people came in just for the freebie, and what percentage
bought something else while they were here?

**gift with purchase** - something that is given to a customer when he or she buys
something, used to show appreciation for their business and to encourage
people to buy more than they normally would

> Jas buys new lipstick only when she knows the department store is offering
gifts with purchase.

**frill** - additional things that are nice to have, but are not necessary

> The spa offers a lot of frills, like champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries,
scented lotion, and relaxing music.

**bells and whistles** - additional items that make something more interesting,
exciting, and attractive, but are not necessary, especially when talking about
technology

> These new smart phones have so many bells and whistles, it's hard to figure
out how to call someone!

**up the creek without a paddle** - in a difficult or challenging situation with few or
no opportunities to find a solution; without an easy way to fix a problem

> Both Paula and her husband lost their jobs last month, and now their mortgage
payment is due and they're up the creek without a paddle.
