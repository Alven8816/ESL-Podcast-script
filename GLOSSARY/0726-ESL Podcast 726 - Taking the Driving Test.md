#### ESL Podcast 726 - Taking the Driving Test

**driving test** - an exam that must be passed to receive permission to drive,
where one drives a car while the examiner sits in the passenger seat, giving
instructions and observing how well one drives

> Nick hit a stop sign during his driving test and didn't pass.

**license** - legal permission to do or have something

> How long have you had a license to carry a gun?

**play-by-play** - detailed information, describing what is happening as it occurs or
every step in a process

> Teenage girls love to share the play-by-play of their dates with each other.

**to freak out** - to be very worried or nervous about something, thinking about it
all the time and not being able to control one's emotions and/or actions

> If the client doesn't sign the contract soon, our boss is going to freak out.

**to fasten (one's) seat belt** - to pull the long piece of fabric across one's chest
and upper legs while sitting in a car or an airplane and connect the metal piece
on the end with the metal piece attached to the seat so that one is attached to
the car or airplane and will not move very much

> Karina refuses to start the car until everyone has fastened their seat belt.

**block** - in a city, the square area and all the buildings in it surrounded by four
crossing streets

> The pharmacy is on the same block as the library.

**stop sign** - a red 8-sided sign with the word "STOP" printed on it in white letters,
letting drivers know they need to stop before going through an intersection (two
crossing streets)

> Did you see that other car? The driver didn't stop at the stop sign and drove
right through the intersection. She could have killed someone!

**traffic signal** - a box with lights that tell drivers when they can drive through an
intersection (two crossing streets) and when they need to stop, usually with a red
light, a yellow light, and a green light

> Is this traffic signal working? It seems like we've been stopped here with a red
light forever.

**freeway** - a wide road with many lanes where cars drive very quickly and do not
need to stop because there are no intersections (two crossing streets)

> Normally cars move quickly on this freeway, but yesterday there was an
accident, so everyone had to drive really slowly.

**onramp** - a short road that joins a freeway at an angle so that cars can increase
their speed until they are going the same speed as the cars on the freeway and
then they can enter the freeway lanes and drive with the rest of the cars

> If an onramp is too short, it can be difficult for drivers to make their cars go fast
enough before they reach the faster cars on the freeway.

**to merge** - for two lanes to join, so that drivers have to make room for each
other so that all the cars can be in one lane

> In rural areas, drivers are more likely to slow down and make room for other
cars to merge onto the freeway.

**to change lanes** - to move one's car from one lane to another one going in the
same direction, usually so that one can drive more quickly or more slowly

> If you want to go faster, change lanes and drive in the passing lane.

**to accelerate** - to increase one's speed; to make something go faster

> Can electric cars accelerate as quickly as gasoline-powered cars?

**to signal** - to make colored lights on the front and back of one's car turn on and
off repeatedly to show other drivers that one wants to turn or change direction

> According to the law, we're supposed to signal about 100 feet before we make
a turn.

**speed limit** - the maximum allowed speed; the fastest speed one can legally
drive at

> The speed limit on many residential streets is just 20 or 25 miles per hour.

**to parallel park** - to park on the side of a street so that one is parallel to the cars
that are moving, with one car in front and another car behind, so that one has to
drive backward and forward several times to fit into the space

> Teraz hates parallel parking, so he spends a lot of time looking for parking lots
with standard parking spaces that he can turn into.

**behind the wheel** - driving a car; sitting in the driver's seat of a car

> Do you think most 16-year-olds are responsible enough to be behind the
wheel?

**to have (got) someplace to be** - a phrase used to show that one should be
somewhere else at a certain time, without providing any details, often used when
one is lying and simply does not want to do whatever the other person is talking
about

> - Can you watch the kids tonight?

> - Uh, no, sorry, I've got someplace to be.
