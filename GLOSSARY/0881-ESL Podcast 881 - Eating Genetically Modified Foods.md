#### ESL Podcast 881 - Eating Genetically Modified Foods

**genetically modified** - with changes having been made to the genes (building
blocks of life) within a plant or animal species

> In the future, will people be genetically modified to protect them from diseases?

**genetically engineered** - created to have some specific characteristics by
controlling the genes (building blocks of life) within a plant or animal species

> This corn has been genetically engineered to need less water and grow taller.

**laboratory** - a room where scientists design and perform experiments, or where
engineers build and test things

> Xavier spends long days at the laboratory, searching for a cure for cancer.

**DNA** - deoxyribonucleic acid; the chemical substance that carries genetic
information within living things

> Piotr is going to request a DNA test to determine whether the little girl is really
his daughter.

**nutrient** - a substance found in food or soil that animals or plants use to grow
and develop

> Growing children need foods with a lot of nutrients, like whole grains and fresh
fruits and vegetables.

**resistant** - not easily damaged by something; not easily harmed or negatively
influenced by something

> This watch is water-resistant, so it's okay to shower with it, but you probably
shouldn't leave it in the water for long periods of time.

**disease** - an illness; a sickness

> Polio, malaria, and many other diseases have been largely eliminated in North
America.

**pest** - an insect or rodent (small animal) that destroys crops, spreads disease,
and causes other types of harm or problems for humans

> Rats are a major pest in large cities.

**mutation** - a genetic change that makes one individual different from other
individuals of the same species

> If a woman is exposed to certain chemicals while she is pregnant, it can result
in mutations that cause birth defects in her baby.

**genetic makeup** - the genetic structure of a particular organism or individual

> Scientists are analyzing the genetic makeup of certain plants to try to make
drugs that imitate their healing properties.

**aversion** - a strong dislike of something; hatred

> Lynn has a strong aversion to milk and doesn't want to eat or drink anything
that has milk in it.

**selective breeding** - the practice of making plants or animals reproduce with
other plants or animals that have particular characteristics that one wants to
increase

> Over thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to make larger
chickens that lay larger eggs more frequently.

**to trust** - to rely on someone; to believe that someone is good or honest and will
not do anything to hurt oneself

> Can I trust you to keep a secret?

**Mother Nature** - the idea of the natural world as a woman who controls what
