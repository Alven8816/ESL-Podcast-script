better than other people can

**half of the picture** - not the whole idea; only a partial understanding of
something; incomplete information about something

> Some people think that expensive gasoline is bad because they can't drive as
much as they want to, but that's only half of the picture, since less driving means
less air pollution, which is a good thing.

possibility that something bad will happen as a result

enough money for.

**to fall by the wayside** - to stop being important or to stop being used because
there are too many other, more important things
