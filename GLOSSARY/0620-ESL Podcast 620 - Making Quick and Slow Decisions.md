#### ESL Podcast 620 - Making Quick and Slow Decisions

**vendor** - a company that sells products or services to another company; supplier

> We could simplify our accounts payable if we reduced the number of vendors
we work with. For example, we could order all our office supplies from just one
company instead of from five different ones.

**to go with** - to choose to use a particular product or a particular service
provider; to choose to have or use a certain thing

> We decided to go with orange paint for painting the dining room.

**hesitant** - pausing and delaying to do or decide something because one isn't
sure

> After everything you just told me about that company, I'm hesitant to accept the
job.

**to ponder** - to consider; to think about something very seriously for a long period
of time

> How often do we stop and take time to ponder the meaning of life?

**rash** - done or decided very quickly, often so quickly that a mistake is made

> They made a rash decision to get married, only knowing each other for a few
weeks.

**to sit on (something)** - to spend a lot of time thinking about something before
one makes a decision

> When they make the job offer, don't respond right away. Sit on it for a few days
and try to figure out whether it's what you really want.

**of two minds** - undecided; able to see the advantages and disadvantages of
doing two different things, but unable to decide which one would be better

> Sandra is of two minds as to whether she should specialize in mechanical or
electrical engineering.

**to switch** - to change from one thing to another; to stop using or doing one thing
so that one can use or do another thing

tea?

**sound** - logical, rational, and well-though-out

> Our school needs a sound policy on how to handle fights between students.

**split-second decision** - a decision made very quickly, without having enough
time to think about it

> When the car in front of him suddenly stopped, Jake made a split-second
decision to turn to the right, and it probably saved his life.

**debatable** - open for discussion; something that people can have more than one
opinion about and therefore should be discussed

good thing is debatable.

**ifs, ands, or buts** - excuses; any reasons for not doing something

**tentative** - possible; uncertain; something that may be changed later; not yet
finalized

the salaries negotiated for the new staff members.

**set in stone** - finalized; clearly determined and agreed upon; not able to be
changed anymore

to make changes after we send it in.

something again at a future time

revisit how household chores were being shared.

solutions

working out?
