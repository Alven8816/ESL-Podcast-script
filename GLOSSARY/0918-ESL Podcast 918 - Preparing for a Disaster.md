**talk radio** - radio programs where a host speaks with invited guests and
listeners who call into the show to discuss certain topics

**doomsday** - the end of the world; Armageddon; a future time when everyone
will die

> Thirty years ago, people thought nuclear weapons would cause doomsday, but
now climate change seems more likely.

**garbage** - something that is worthless; something that has no value

> All of those ideas are garbage! Can't you guys come up with any more
interesting proposals?

**impending** - happening soon and bringing negative consequences

> Everyone is nervous about the impending storm.

**to cry wolf** - to say that something bad is going to happen when it is not true,
often to play a joke or trick another person, based on a traditional story about a
boy who was protecting sheep and told people in the village that a wolf was
coming, just to laugh at their reaction, but then when the wolf actually came
nobody believed him

> Are we really in danger of losing the client, or are you just crying wolf?

**proof** - evidence; something that shows the truth of something

> Do you have any proof that the housecleaner stole your jewelry?

**to sound the alarm** - to warn people about some danger or problem, especially
before most other people are aware of it

> If you suspect fraud, you have a responsibility to sound the alarm and let
management know about it.

**canary in the coal mine** - an early indicator of a problem or a dangerous
situation, based on how people used to lower canaries (small birds) into
underground areas to test for dangerous air, so that if the bird died, they knew
the area was not safe for humans

> The company decided to open one small office in southeast Asia as a canary in
the coal mine to determine whether further international expansion would be a
good idea.

**disaster** - a bad, dangerous, and uncontrollable situation, especially caused by
natural forces like hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods

> The Carlsons have a suitcase filled with flashlights, a radio, batteries, canned
food, and water, just so they can be prepared for any disasters.

**voice of reason** - a person who is calm, logical, and rational while speaking to
other people who are panicked and not able to think clearly

> Whenever Trent becomes stressed out from school and work, he calls his
father, who can always offer him a voice of reason.

**for real** - actually happening; not imaginary or pretend; reality

> Was that offer for real, or were they just teasing us?

**disruption** - an interruption; a temporary stop in some service; a brief stop in
something

> When the tree fell, it knocked down a power line and caused a disruption in
electric service to homes and businesses.

**a run on** - a situation where many people want to buy or have the same thing,
more than the amount available

> Right before the storm, there was a run on flashlights, batteries, and bottled
water.

**chaos** - disorder; an extreme lack or order and organization; a situation where
things are very unpredictable and nobody is in control

> There's so much chaos in this office, I don't understand how you can get
anything done.

**underground bunker** - a safe room below the earth's surface, made with very
strong walls and a locking door, that allows a person to live safely through any
situation for a certain period of time

> Kevin built an underground bunker to protect his family in case there's a major
earthquake or a war.

**to dig** - to excavate; to use tools to move earth away from an area to create a
hole in the ground

> How long did it take you to dig that hole and to plant that tree?
