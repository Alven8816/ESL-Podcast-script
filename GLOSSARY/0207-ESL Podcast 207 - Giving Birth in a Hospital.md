#### ESL Podcast 207 - Giving Birth in a Hospital

**pregnant** - a woman (or female animal), when she will be having a baby

got pregnant again.

**to have (one's) water break** - to have the "membrane," or thin skin where the
baby is located inside of a woman's stomach break and for the fluid inside to
come out

> Now that I'm in my eighth month of pregnancy, I'm starting to worry that my
water will break while I'm at work.

**contraction** - a painful feeling when a woman's muscles tighten, usually before
a baby is born, that becomes more frequent the closer it is to the birth of the baby

> The contractions started while she was eating dinner and her husband took her
to the hospital.

**in labor** - in the act of giving birth to a baby

> After being in labor for seven hours, she told her family that she will never have
another baby!

> We tried paging Dora for this important phone call, but she must not be carrying
her pager right now.

**maternity ward** - a part of the hospital where babies are born

> Do you want to go with me to the maternity ward when it's time for the baby to
be born?

**reception desk** - an area where guests stop first in a public place or place of
business

> Since Elias wasn't in his office in the morning, I left a message for him at the
reception desk.

**to admit** - at a hospital, to be received as a patient, usually to stay overnight

> The doctor told me that he wanted to admit me into the hospital so that they
could run some tests.

**insurance card** - a card provided by the insurance company showing that you
have coverage, or that the company will help pay

> When I arrived at my dentist's office, I realized that I had forgotten my dental
insurance card at home.

hospital

> The birthing suite has everything the doctor needs to deliver a healthy baby.

**false labor** - a feeling when a woman's muscles tighten while she is pregnant,
but that is not actually a sign that the baby will be born soon

> After two false labors, the doctor told her to stay in bed as much as possible.

**far along** - the amount of time, usually in months or weeks, a woman has been
pregnant already

> When she told us that she was pregnant, we asked her how far along she was.

**head first/breech** - when a baby is born, the part of the baby that appears first:
the head (head first) or feet (breech)

> My son was born breech but my daughter came out head first.

**to be relieved** - to stop being in pain or difficulty; to stop worrying

> We were all so relieved when the police rescued her son from the top of the
building.

employees have gone home.
