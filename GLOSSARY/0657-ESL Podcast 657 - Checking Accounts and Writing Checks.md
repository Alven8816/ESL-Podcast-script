#### ESL Podcast 657 - Checking Accounts and Writing Checks

**notice** - notification; an official written statement letting one know something

> The library sends me an email notice whenever it's time to take back the books
I've checked out.

**to bounce** - for a check to not be paid and instead be returned to the person
who tried to make the deposit, because it was written for an amount that is
greater than the amount of money in the bank account

> This rental agreement says that if our check bounces, we have to pay the
landlord an extra $75.

**overdraft** - an instance when one owes a bank money because one has spent
more money than one has

> The bank covers my overdrafts up to $200 per day, but it charges me $25 each
time.

**bank statement** - a written report, usually sent monthly, showing how much
money one has in one's bank account, as well as all the money that was put in
and all the money that was taken out during a specific period

> If you don't recognize a transaction on your bank statement, be sure to call the
bank right away to report it.

**deposit** - money put into one's bank account

> Please make a deposit into our checking account today, or we won't have
enough money to pay the bills tonight.

**withdrawal** - money taken out of one's bank account

> Does the bank limit how many withdrawals you can make each month?

**fee** - money paid for a particular purpose; the amount of money paid in order to
do something, or to have someone do something for oneself

> How much is the late fee if we return our DVDs to the movie rental store one
day late?

**minimum balance** - the smallest amount of money that one must have in one's
bank account to keep the account open or to avoid paying a fee

> As long as we maintain the minimum balance, the bank pays us interest on our
account.

**direct deposit** - the process of having one's payments sent directly to one's
bank account electronically, without the need to take a check or cash to the bank

> Direct deposit is really convenient because employees don't have to take their
check to the bank every two weeks, and nobody loses their check.

**paycheck** - money paid to an employee for the work that he or she has done,
usually weekly, biweekly (every two weeks), or monthly

> My paycheck would be a lot bigger if my employer didn't have to send part of
my salary to the government for taxes.

**ATM card** - a small, rectangular piece of plastic that is used with a four-number
code to take money out of one's bank account at an ATM (automated teller
machine)

> I lost my ATM card and called the bank right away so they could send me a
new one.

**deducted** - subtracted; taken away; reduced

> Chrissy has the payments for her Internet connection deducted from her bank
account automatically every month.

**sneaky** - tricky; slightly dishonest or deceptive; without being clear about what
one is doing

> Some cell phone companies are really sneaky, always making new customers
sign a two-year agreement and pay a lot of money if they want to end their
service early.

**to count on** - to rely on; to depend on; to assume and believe that something
will happen

> That boy's parents are counting on the surgeon to save his life.

**terms and conditions** - the detailed part of a contract that specifies all the
rights, responsibilities, and consequences associated with an agreement

> Can we renew our lease without changing the terms and conditions?

**had it** - a phrase used to show that one is tired and frustrated with something
and will not continue to use or have it anymore

> This computer is too slow! I've had it! I'm going to go buy a new one today.

**to take (one's) business elsewhere** - to begin using the services of a different
company because one was very dissatisfied with the service received from the
first company

> If you can't deliver my order by tomorrow, I'll take my business elsewhere.
