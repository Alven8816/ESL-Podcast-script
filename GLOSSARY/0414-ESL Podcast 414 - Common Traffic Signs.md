#### ESL Podcast 414 - Common Traffic Signs

**to squint** - to mostly close one's eyes so that only a small part of the eye can be
seen and the skin around the eye is very wrinkled, usually because there is too
much light or because one has poor vision

> When Younceoul saw that her son was squinting, she decided to take him to
the eye doctor to see if he needed glasses.

**sign** - a large piece of wood, metal, plastic, or paper that has writing and/or
pictures on it, giving people information, especially about what they should do or
where they should go

> According to that sign, Disneyland is just 20 miles further.

**dead end** - a street that ends without connecting to another street, making cars
turn around

> The Seelig family wants to live on a dead end so that there will be fewer cars
driving by and their kids can play in the street more safely.

**no U-turn** - a sign that lets drivers know that they are not allowed to turn around
and change direction in the road

> There's a big "no U-turn sign" on the road, so we had to use a store's parking
lot to turn around.

**do not enter** - a sign that lets people know that they should not enter or drive on
a particular street or area, usually because it would be dangerous because cars
are coming the other way

> The city put a "Do Not Enter" sign at the entrance to the freeway when it had to
close the freeway for two weeks of construction.

**one way** - a sign that lets drivers know that cars are allowed to drive in only one
direction on a particular street

> All of the downtown streets are one-way, which makes it very hard to get to
some of the buildings.

**to pull off (the road/street)** - to slow down one's car and stop driving, putting
one's car on the side of the road or street for a short period of time

> When Pauline's car started making strange noises, she pulled off the road and
looked at the engine.

**no stopping** - a sign that lets drivers know that they should not stop in a
particular part of the street and must continue driving

> Drivers were stopping in front of the airport, making it difficult for people to drive
in the street, so the airport put up "No Stopping" signs.

**back on track** - doing something correctly after a period of time when one was
doing it incorrectly

> Ulysses did very poorly in school last year, but now he is back on track, getting
good scores on his exams.

**speed bump** - a small section of the road that is higher than the rest of the road,
placed so that cars have to drive over it very slowly, used to make drivers drive
more slowly in a particular area

> People drive through our neighborhood too quickly, so we want to have some
speed bumps to slow them down.

**blind** - unable to see; without the ability to see; without vision

> Izra is blind, but he has learned how to read Braille by touching special pages in
books with his fingers.

**school crossing** - an area where many children cross the street next to a
school; an area where many children go from one side of the street to another as
they go to and from school

were a lot of children walking there.

place

the store's door, hoping that someone would find it for her.

particular area; the fastest speed that is allowed in an area

> This little light will start to flash when the camera needs a new battery.

**detour** - an alternate route; a way to go from one place to another place when
the normal way is closed, usually because of construction or a special event

> More than 3,000 runners are running downtown today, so there are a lot of
detours for cars to go around them.

something will happen, even though one wants it to happen

> I studied so much, but I still didn't do well on the exam. Will I never get an "A"?
