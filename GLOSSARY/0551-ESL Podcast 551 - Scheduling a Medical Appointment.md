**appointment** - a scheduled meeting; a specific date and time when one will do
something

> Each October, Clarke makes an appointment to get his teeth cleaned at the
dentist's office.

pay for his or her medical expenses

his doctor.

**patient** - a person who receives medical advice and/or treatment from a doctor,
clinic, or hospital

> The patient in room 2B is asking to see you, Doctor.

**to route** - to send a call to the right person or in the right direction, and
especially to connect a caller with the right office when he or she is calling a large
organization or business

> The receptionist is responsible for routing calls to the company's many
departments.

**to stay on the line** - to hold; to not hang up the phone; to wait on the phone until
someone is available

> Whenever I call the bank, I have to stay on the line for at least ten minutes
before I can speak with a real person. It's very frustrating.

**medical group** - a clinic; a group of doctors who work together in the same
building

> Could you please recommend a good medical group in the Dallas area? Our
family needs a medical group with a good general practitioner and a pediatrician.

**returning** - a repeat client; referring to a client or patient who has used the
services of a particular business or doctor before and is requesting another
meeting or appointment

> More than 90% of our new patients become returning patients, so we know
we're providing good service that makes them want to come back.

**to refer** - to recommend that someone see a particular doctor, work with a
particular company, or shop at a particular store

> Our friends referred us to you. They said you helped them buy their first home
last year, and they really enjoyed working with you.

**health benefit** - one of the things that a medical insurance plan pays for while
the individual pays little or nothing

> This insurance coverage isn't very good. The health benefits exclude physical
therapy, prenatal care, and all prescriptions.

**to self-refer** - to be able to request to see a certain doctor without first needing a
referral (recommendation and approval) from one's doctor or approval from one's
insurance plan

> Pyotr needs to see an ophthalmologist, but because his insurance plan doesn't
allow him to self-refer, he has to see his regular doctor first and request a
referral.

**specialist** - a doctor who is an expert in a specific area of medicine and works
only in that area

> In her third year of medical school, Yasushi decided she's like to become a
cancer specialist.

**medical record number** - an identifying number in a medical insurance plan or
at a doctor's office, used to find one's papers quickly and easily

> If you don't have your medical record number, we'll have to look up your
account information with your last name and telephone number.

**booked up** - with a busy, full schedule; without any unscheduled time on one's
calendar

scheduled yet during that time

**to check in** - to come to an office or conference and officially speak with
someone to let people know that one has arrived and is ready for the
appointment or meeting

> When you arrive at our office building, please check in with the receptionist and
