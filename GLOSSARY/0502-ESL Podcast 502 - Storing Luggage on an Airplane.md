#### ESL Podcast 502 - Storing Luggage on an Airplane

**roller bag** - a suitcase that is on wheels with a long handle, so that it can be
pulled instead of carried

> This suitcase is too heavy to carry! It would be much easier to travel with a
roller bag.

**aisle** - a long, narrow space for walking between two shelves, rows of seats, or
other things

> The grocery store keeps rice and noodles in aisle seven.

**overhead bin** - the area inside an airplane, above the seats, where people can
put their bags inside and then close the door to keep them there during the flight

> Each passenger is allowed to put one item in the overhead bins.

**to store** - to keep something in a safe place for a period of time so that it can be
used later

> If you don't have a garage, where are you going to store your bicycle?

**carry-on** - a small bag that can be brought onto a plane with a traveler, without
needing to be put in the storage area below the passenger area of the plane

> It's always a good idea to have a carry-on bag with medicine, a toothbrush, and
an extra set of clothing.

**cramped** - crowded; without enough room or space to feel comfortable or move
one's body freely

> They work in a very small office that always feels cramped.

**legroom** - space in front of a seat where one can put one's legs, especially on a
plane or in a car

> Sports cars don't have very much legroom for passengers in the backseat.

**emergency exit row** - one of the larger rows of seats on an airplane, with
additional space between it and the row of seats in front of it, next to a door that
can be opened only if there is a major problem and people need to get off the
airplane immediately without using the regular door

> People who sit in the emergency exit row must be able to help other people off
of an airplane in an emergency.

**to recline** - to lean backwards, especially while sitting in a chair where the back
of the seat can move backward toward the floor

> This couch would be much more comfortable if it could recline.

**bulkhead** - a type of wall that separates the different parts of a plane or ship

> He spent most of the flight watching a movie on the TV that was hanging on the
bulkhead.

**to grumble** - to complain quietly; to say something negative in a quiet voice

does the work.

or without waiting for something else to happen first

> We have a lot of work to do today, so let's get moving.

**to snag** - to grab or get something quickly, especially before another person can
do it

> Who snagged all of the cookies I just made?

**to check (one's) bag** - to give a suitcase to an airline employee so that it can be
placed in the bottom of the plane where one won't have access to it until the
plane lands.

> This bag is too big to bring onto the airplane. You will need to check your bag.

**unwind** - relax; stop feeling stressed or anxious

> At the end of a long week, they like to unwind by sitting in their backyard and
watching the animals.
