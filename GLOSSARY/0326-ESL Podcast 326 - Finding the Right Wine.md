having anything

**table wine** - an inexpensive type of wine that is drunk with meals, not for special
occasions

nice one and not just the cheap table wine that we drink normally.

through easily

**red** - a type of wine that has a dark red or purple color and that one cannot see
through easily

**full-/light-bodied** - having a very strong (full-) or weak (light-) taste or smell

really taste the food.
