#### ESL Podcast 760 - Paycheck Deductions

**It's about time** - an expression used when one is pleased that something has
finally happened after waiting for it for a long time and believing that it should
have happened long ago

> It's about time we received a thank you email from Jameel! We gave him that
gift more than two months ago.

**paycheck** - payment of the money one has earned by working, usually received
twice a month or every week

> I won't be able to pay you until I receive my paycheck on the 15th
.

**eye-opener** - a surprising experience that teaches something new in an
unexpected way

> Volunteering at the homeless shelter was an eye-opener.

**pay stub** - a document given to an employee that explains how the amount of
his or her paycheck was calculated, showing how much money was deducted
(subtracted) for different purposes

> Save your pay stubs so that at the end of the year, you can see how much
money you've contributed to your retirement funds.

**deduction** - something that is subtracted from something else, especially money
taken away from what one has earned through working

> Many charities allow you to contribute through an automatic deduction from
your paycheck each month.

**income tax** - money collected by the government as a percentage of the amount
of money each worker makes

> Do you think people who make a lot of money should pay higher income taxes
than people who don't make very much money?

**FICA** - Federal Insurance Contributions Act; the law that requires employers to
hold part of the money their employees make for national benefit programs for
retirement, disability, and healthcare

> The money taken out of your paycheck for FICA probably won't be enough for a
comfortable retirement, so it's a good idea to save money for retirement in private
accounts, too.

**Social Security** - a federal insurance program that gives money to Americans
who have retired, lost their job, or become disabled

> When Harvey died in his 30s, his wife and two children began receiving his
Social Security benefits each month.

**Medicare** - a federal health insurance program for older people and people who
become disabled and cannot work

> Medicare pays for only part of Grandpa's medical visits and prescriptions, and
he has to pay for the rest of it with his own money.

**retirement contribution** - money taken out of one's paycheck and put in a
special account to save for retirement (the period of time toward the end of one's
life when one no longer works)

> The company matches 20% of its employees' retirement contributions.

**to account for** - to explain; to offer a reason

> Janeen is upset about her cat's death, but that doesn't account for her angry
behavior.

**wages** - money paid to an employee every day, week, or month, especially for
unskilled labor paid by the hour

> Her wages barely cover rent and food. She needs to find a higher-paying job.

**to garnish** - to hold part of the amount of an employee's paychecks so that the
money can be used to meet some financial obligation that the employee has not
paid freely in the past

> If you don't start paying alimony to your ex-husband, the court might decide to
garnish your wages.

**child support** - money paid to cover the cost of having someone else raise
one's child, such as food, housing, and tuition

> After the divorce, the kids went to live with their mother and their father had to
pay $750 in child support each month.
