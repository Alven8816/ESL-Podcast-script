#### ESL Podcast 851 - Finding a House to Buy

**single-family** - a home designed for one family to live in a single building; not
multiple units that are connected

> Urban planners struggle to connect single-family homes to city centers without
having too much traffic.

**townhouse** - a narrow, tall home, usually with two or three floors, built right next
to other townhouses on each side so that they share walls and there is no open
space between them

> Dynee loves the way the townhouses look in San Francisco, but she wouldn't
want to live in one.

**common wall** - a wall that is shared between two rooms, homes, or buildings

> I wonder if our neighbors can hear our conversations through this common wall.

**yard** - an outdoor area next to a home, owned by and belonging to the home
owner

> They're buying swings and a slide to put in their yard so the kids can play.

**square footage** - the number of square feet (ft2
) in an area; a measurement of
the size of a home or building

> How can they get so many bedrooms in so little square footage? This website
says the home is only 1,600 square feet, but it has four bedrooms and three
bathrooms!

**lot size** - the size of the piece of land on which a home is built; the size of the
land that is sold with a home

> If you don't like gardening and yard work, you should probably buy a home with
a smaller lot size.

**open floor plan** - an architectural design of a home or office that has a lot of
open space and few walls

> The home has a nice, open floor plan, so you can see into the living room and
dining room from the kitchen.

**curb appeal** - the attractiveness of a home from the street; a home that looks
nice when viewed from outside

> Realtors recommend painting, watering the grass, and planting flowers to
improve curb appeal before trying to sell a home.

**upgrade** - an improvement; the replacement of one thing by something that is
nicer, more luxurious, and/or more expensive

> They're planning to invest in a lot of upgrades in the kitchen, like stainless steel
appliances and granite countertops.

**fixer-upper** - a home that has many structural and/or cosmetic (visual or
aesthetic) problems and will require that the new owners invest a lot of time and
money for improvements

> The home is really inexpensive, but that's because it's a fixer-upper. Once we
have paid for all the repairs, it won't seem inexpensive at all!

**move-in condition** - ready to live in; ready for the new owners to move into a
home without needing to do any work on it first

> The home is almost in move-in condition. We just need to fix the heating
system and install new carpet.

**mortgage** - a loan used to buy a home; a home loan

> Currently, mortgage rates are lower than they have been in years, so many
people can afford to buy a home.

**to hold out for** - to wait to do something until one gets or receives something
better

> Suzanne has received three job offers, but she's holding out for one that offers
a higher salary and more vacation time.

**mansion** - a very large, luxurious, and expensive home

> Most of the mansions in that neighborhood cost between $2 million and $5
million.

**a step up from** - an improvement over; something that is better than what one
previously had or did

> The Porsche is a huge step up from the Honda Civic Tim used to own.

**expectation** - what one anticipates; what one believes will happen or be true;
the belief one has about a situation or event before one experiences it

> Hannah grew up with her parents' expectations that she would become a
lawyer.
