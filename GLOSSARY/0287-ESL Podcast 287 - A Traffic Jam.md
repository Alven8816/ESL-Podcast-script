#### ESL Podcast 287 - A Traffic Jam

**traffic jam** - when there are so many cars on a road that they move very slowly,
or cannot move at all

> There are traffic jams every morning on many of the freeways in Los Angeles.

**congested** - with many cars that are moving very slowly, without very much
room between cars

> Main Street is congested at this time of day. Let's drive on a different road.

**bridge** - a part of a road that is built over water or another road so that cars or
people can cross over

> The city of Eugene is building a new bridge over the Willamette River.

**to have no choice but to...** - to be forced to do something; to have no other
option but...; to have no choice to do anything except...

> We were lost in the forest, very hungry and tired, but we had no choice but to
continue walking to try to get home.

**bumper-to-bumper** - with very little space between cars, so that their "bumpers"
(the long pieces of metal on the front and back of a car) are almost touching

> When I'm driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic, I have to pay attention because if
the car in front of me stops suddenly, I'll have to stop very quickly, too.

**shoulder** - the side of a road, where cars should not drive; the side of the road,
where cars can stop if there is an emergency

> Too many people throw their garbage onto the road's shoulder.

**backup** - the area where cars are moving slowly or not at all because there is
too much traffic

> We heard on the radio that there's a big backup on the freeway, so we're going
to wait a few hours before starting to drive home.

**to bypass** - to go around something

> You can bypass the construction if you drive down Lincoln Street.

**stalled car** - a car that has stopped working while it is on the road

> The other cars are honking because there's a stalled car in the intersection and
it's blocking traffic.

**rubbernecker** - a person who slows down his or her car to look out the window
and see an accident, making the cars behind it slow down

> Let's not be rubberneckers! When we pass that accident, let's look straight
ahead and continue driving at a normal speed.

**road construction** - the process of fixing a road, usually requiring that all or part
of the road be closed temporarily

> There's a lot of road construction on Highway 58, because the government is
making it wider.

**lane** - the space between painted lines on the road that is meant for one line of
cars

> Slower cars should be in the right-hand lane, and faster cars should be in the
left-hand lane.

**stop-and-go traffic** - cars that move a short distance, then stop, then move
another short distance, then stop, and so on

> In the stop-and-go traffic, it took me 50 minutes to get home, when it usually
takes only 15 minutes.

**at my wit's end** - very frustrated; desperate; feeling like one will go crazy

> After spending more than eight hours in a classroom with 30 noisy six-year-
olds, I was at my wit's end!

**recklessly** - not carefully; without being cautious; dangerously

> Timothy was in a car accident because he was driving recklessly.

**to make up for lost time** - to do something quickly because one was delayed
and wasn't able to do it earlier

> The team had to work on some other things last week, so now it's making up for
lost time, staying at the office very late to finish the project.

**to stand (someone) up** - to not meet someone when one is supposed to,
especially if the two people arranged a romantic date

> Tanya waited at the restaurant for 30 minutes before she realized that Dorian
had stood her up.
