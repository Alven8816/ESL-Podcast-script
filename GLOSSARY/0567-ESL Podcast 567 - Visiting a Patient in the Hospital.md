with time to spare

> Fredy accidentally slept in, but he hurried and got to work just in time, arriving a
few seconds before 8:00.

**visiting hours** - the periods of time when people are allowed to see and speak
with patients at a hospital, because during the other periods of time the patients
must be left alone with the doctors and nurses

tomorrow at 1:00.

**emergency ward** - the part of a hospital that deals with patients who have very
serious problems that need immediate attention

**life support** - machines that keep a person alive by making oxygen flow through
one's lungs and by making one's heart beat

> Grandma is working with a lawyer to make sure that doctors never put her on

health and things are going well

that observe one's heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and more

hooked up to monitors.

**IV drip** - a clear plastic bag that is filled with liquid and hangs next to a patient
with a long, thin plastic tube that connects it to a needle placed inside the
patient's vein, used to put liquid, nutrients, and medication in the patient's
bloodstream
