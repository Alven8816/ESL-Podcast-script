**earthquake** - a short period of time when the ground shakes because of
geological movements deep below the surface, often causing damage, injuries,
and/or death

the course of their lives.

**to occur** - to happen; to take place

> Police are trying to determine exactly when the murder occurred.

**seismologist** - a scientist who studies earthquakes and the movement of the
earth

> Seismologists say a major earthquake will happen here sometime within the
next 50 years, but they can't provide a more specific date or time.

**magnitude** - the size of something; how big or small something is

> If they understood the real magnitude of the problem, they would be much more
concerned with finding a solution.

**Richter scale** - a number-based system for measuring and reporting the size
and strength of earthquakes

> The earthquake was only 2.0 on the Richter scale, so we couldn't really feel it.

**epicenter** - the center of an earthquake; the exact point on the earth's surface
where an earthquake is strongest

> Although it was a large earthquake, it didn't cause very much damage, because
there weren't any cities near the epicenter.

**fault** - fault line; a large crack or long hole in the earth's surface where parts of
the earth are moving away from each other

**aftershock** - one of many small earthquakes that happens soon after a large
earthquake

> After the earthquake, people were warned not to go back into their houses until
all the aftershocks had ended.

**high-intensity** - very strong and powerful, but normally lasting for only a short
period of time

> If you want to lose weight, is it better to do a short, high-intensity workout or a
longer, low-intensity workout?

to another country or an area that is in an emergency and needs a lot of help
