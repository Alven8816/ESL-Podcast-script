#### ESL Podcast 813 - Doing Basic Exercises

**workout** - a period of exercise; a period of time spent using one's body in
physically challenging ways to improve one's health, strength, and/or endurance

> Hal likes to ride bikes during the summer, but in colder months, his favorite
workout is to swim in the indoor pool.

**gym** - gymnasium; a large building where people exercise and play sports,
usually with many aerobic machines, weights, and areas to play sports

> This gym has two basketball courts, a swimming pool, and a sauna.

**to exercise** - to use one's body in physically challenging ways to improve one's
health, strength, and/or endurance

> Karina tries to exercise at least 20 minutes each day.

**calisthenics** - exercises that improve strength and flexibility through simple
movements like bending or twisting

> This website teaches some simple calisthenics that you can do without leaving
your desk.

**to stretch** - to move one's body in ways that push or pull parts as far as they
can comfortably go

> If you stretch every day, soon you'll be able to touch your toes without bending
your knees.

**sit-up** - an exercise that involves lying down on one's back, putting one's hands
behind one's head, and moving into a sitting position by using the muscles in
one's abdomen (stomach area)

> When you do a sit-up, don't pull on your head and neck with your hand. Use the
muscles in your abdomen instead.

**push-up** - an exercise that involves lying down on one's stomach, putting one's
hands flat on the floor, and pushing until one's arms are straight so that only
one's toes and hands are touching the floor

> If you aren't strong enough to do a real push-up, try to do it on your knees
instead of your toes.

**pull-up** - an exercise that involves hanging from a metal bar by one's hands and
then pulling up, bending the elbows so that one's chin reaches over the bar

> The soldiers have to be able to do at least 10 pull-ups without stopping.

**in shape** - physically fit; healthy and in good physical condition

> Darci couldn't run for a few months after her knee injury, and then it took her
several weeks to get in shape again.

**lunge** - an exercise that involves a rapid, forward movement with one's body,
usually by standing with one's legs apart, one in front of the other, and then
quickly shifting one's weight to the forward leg

> To prevent injury from lunges, make sure your knee is positioned over your
toes.

**squat** - an exercise that involves standing and then bending one's knees so that
one's bottom and thighs (the part of the leg between one's knees and hips) are
close to one's feet, using the thigh muscles to support one's weight

> The dancers are so strong! They're able to hold a squat for several minutes at a
time.

**free weight** - a heavy object held in one's hands to build one's strength, where
the heavy object is not attached to or controlled by a machine

> When working with free weights, it's important to carefully control body
movements to avoid an injury.

**cardio workout** - cardiovascular exercise; challenging physical movements
designed to increase one's heart rate so that the heart muscle becomes stronger
and the body uses a lot of calories (energy obtained from food)

> Certain types of Latin dancing is a lot of fun, and a great cardio workout.

**jumping jacks** - an exercise that involves jumping to alternate between two
positions: (1) standing with one's legs together and one's arms hanging down so
that one's hands are the sides of one's upper legs and (2) standing with one's
legs apart and one's hands held up above one's head

> It's funny to watch little kids try to do jumping jacks, because they don't have
enough coordination to move their arms and legs at the same time.

**in place** - in one place, without moving to a different place; without movement
over a distance

> The marching band often practices its music while marching in place, instead of
moving across the field.

**to jump rope** - to hold a long rope (heavy, thick string) with one end in each
hand and swing it in circles over one's head and under one's feet, jumping over it
each time it hits the ground

> Have you ever tried to jump rope with two ropes at once?

**to see the light** - to suddenly understand that another way is better and begin to
do something that way

> Oliver used to have a lot of credit card debt, but a few months ago, he saw the
light and now he pays for everything with cash.
