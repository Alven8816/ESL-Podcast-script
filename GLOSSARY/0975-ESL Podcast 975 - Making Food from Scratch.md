#### ESL Podcast 975 - Making Food from Scratch

**from scratch** - starting with basic ingredients, not using any prepackaged or
pre-prepared foods

> Why would you make pancakes from scratch when it's so much easier to make
them from this mix?

**to pull out all the stops** - to do something in a big, elaborate way; to do
something fully and take it to an extreme; to do something in the best way one
can

> When they redecorated their living room, they pulled out all the stops, with new
furniture, flooring, paint, windows, curtains, and light fixtures.

**pantry** - a small room next to a kitchen used to store food that does not have to
be refrigerated (kept cold)

> The pantry has a lot of jams and jellies from the berries we picked last summer.

**canned food** - food that is already prepared and sold in sealed tin cans that
preserve it for many years

> It's a good idea to have canned food in case of an earthquake or a similar
emergency, but make sure you have a can opener, too.

**jar** - a glass bottle with a round opening and a lid that screws onto it

> Could you pick up a jar of peanut butter at the store?

**premixed** - with the ingredients already measure and stirred together

> The flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder are already premixed, so you just
have to add an egg and some milk and then pour everything into a baking pan.

**up to** - ready and prepared to do something; having the energy, skills,
knowledge, and commitment needed to do something

> Are you sure you're up to watching the neighbors' three-year-old sons? They
are a lot of work.

**ingredient** - a food used in combination with other foods to cook or bake
something else to eat

> This ice cream has just four ingredients: cream, milk, sugar, and vanilla.

**fresh** - recently picked or recently prepared; not stored for a long period of time

> Fresh beef has a reddish color. It shouldn't be brown like that.

**recipe** - instructions for cooking or baking something

> The recipe calls for two tablespoons of lemon juice, but I don't have any. Do
you think I can use lime juice instead?

**closely** - with a lot of attention to detail; carefully

> Listen closely, because he's only going to explain it once.

**herbs and spices** - small parts of plants, often dried, that have a lot of flavor in
small quantities.

> Oregano, basil, and rosemary are common herbs and spices in Italian cooking.

**to multitask** - to do multiple things at the same time

> The receptionist will need to answer phone calls, greet customers, distribute the
mail, and do data entry, so we'll need to hire someone who can multitask well.

**a juggling act** - a complex performance that requires handling many things at
the same time, paying attention to everything at once

> Hannah's life is a juggling act. She's a full-time employee, a community
volunteer, a part-time student, and a mother!

**to pull this off** - to be able to do something that is difficult or challenging

> We have to find a new place to live in just four days. Do you really think we'll be
able to pull this off?

**challenge** - an invitation or dare to do something that will be difficult, especially
when it represents an opportunity to compete against other people or to show
that one is better at doing something than others are

> Running a marathon will be a huge challenge, but Henrique is determined and
training very hard for it.

**backup plan** - a plan B; an alternative; what one will do if one's first plan does
not work

> Kevin hopes his band will become an international success, but he's getting a
degree in engineering as a backup plan.

**raw food movement** - interest or effort to promote the eating of foods that are
not cooked

> People involved in the raw food movement argue that our bodies can get more
nutrients out of uncooked foods, but some doctors disagree.
