#### ESL Podcast 907 - Buying Tools at a Hardware Store

**DIY** - do it yourself; a project done by an individual without any special
experience or training, and without hiring specialists or professionals

> If you have to cut a hole in the roof to install the skylight, it probably isn't a DIY
project.

**power tool** - a tool that plugs into the wall and is operated with electricity

> You have to complete the training and earn certification before the company will
allow you to use any of the power tools.

**hand tool** - a tool that is held in one's hand and operated by one's physical
movements, without the use of electricity.

> There isn't much space to work in here, so I'll need to use my smallest hand
tools.

**hammer** - a tool with a wooden handle and a heavy metal end, used to hit nails
so that they are pushed into a piece of wood or a wall

> Don't use a stapler to try to pound those nails! Use a hammer instead.

**wrench** - a metal tool with a metal handle and an open u-shaped piece of metal
at the top, used to hold onto nuts or a pipe and make them turn

> This is too tight for me to unscrew with my hand, but I bet I could do it with a
wrench.

**chisel** - a tool with a wooden handle and a long, flat piece of metal at the other
end, used to shape a piece of wood, separate tile from a wall, and to perform
other tasks that need a fine edge

> We used a chisel and a hammer to chip away the rock wall.

**pliers** - a tool shaped like scissors, with metal or plastic handles and a metal tip
that can open and close, used to grab small items, possibly to turn or cut them

> Use these pliers to hold the wires in place while I pull at them from the other
side.

**screwdriver** - a tool with a metal or wooden handle and a pointed piece of metal
at the other end that fits into a screw and can be used to turn it as it pushes into
a piece of wood or metal

> The directions say to use a screwdriver to attach the shelf to the back of this
bookcase.

**nail gun** - a tool that pushes nails into wood with a lot of force and a loud,
popping sound, eliminating the need for a hammer

> Professional roofers use nail guns instead of hammers, because they can
install the roofing material much more quickly that way.

**power drill** - a machine that uses electricity to create a narrow, deep hole in or
through a piece of wood

> Use a power drill to make a small hole first, and then it will be easier to put the
screw in.

**sander** - a machine that uses electricity to make a rough wooden surface
smoother by rubbing it with "sandpaper"

> Yesterday they finished installing the boards on the back deck. Today they're
sanding it with a sander, and tomorrow they'll paint it.

**table saw** - a large machine that uses electricity to cut boards of wood, with a
person guiding them over a table that has a large cutting blade that spins very
quickly in the middle of the table

> For safety, always wear eye protection and gloves when using a table saw, and
be careful not to touch the blade while it is spinning.

**repair** - a fix; a correction or modification to make something work again after it
has broken

> The bike store charged me $50 for the seat repair.

**to remodel** - to change the structure or layout of something, especially a home,
often removing or adding walls or rooms

> We'd love to remodel our home so that it has two bathrooms.

**to count (one's) lucky stars** - to be very grateful for something that has
happened, but that one has little or no control over

> Every day we thank out lucky stars for our good health.
