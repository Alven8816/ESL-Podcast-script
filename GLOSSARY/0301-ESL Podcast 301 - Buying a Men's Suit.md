#### ESL Podcast 301 - Buying a Men's Suit

**suit** - professional clothing of a jacket and pants made from the same fabric

> I always wear my best suit to important business meetings.

**contemporary** - modern; related to the present time; not old-fashioned; not
dated

> Shelly likes contemporary music, but her cousin prefers classical music by
Bach and Mozart.

**to try on** - to put on a piece of clothing to see how well it fits and decide whether
one likes it and wants to buy it

> Yvonne tried on the sweater, but it was too big, so she's now looking for the
same sweater in a smaller size.

**button** - a round piece of plastic, wood, metal, or glass, that is sewn onto a
piece of fabric and goes through a hole in another part of the fabric, to keep the
two pieces held together

> Do you prefer jackets with buttons or zippers?

**pinstripe** - very thin light-colored lines that are printed vertically (up and down)
on dark fabric, often used for making business suits

> Should I wear this dark blue pinstripe suit or a plain black suit?

**wool** - fabric that is made from the hair of a sheep, goat, or similar animal

> Wool sweaters will keep you warm in cold weather, even if they get wet.

**flat front** - without any design or detailed sewing on the front; plain in the front

> Flat-front pants make you look thinner than do pants with lots of extra fabric.

**double-breasted** - a jacket that has two front parts, each with buttons, so that
when the jacket is closed one part goes over the other part, and two columns
(lines) of buttons are showing

> Since I'm big and tall, I look better in double-breasted jackets because the
buttons cover my chest and stomach.

**lined** - having a layer of fabric sewn to the inside of one's clothing to make it
look more professional

> If you buy white pants, make sure that they're lined so that people can't see
through the fabric.

**pleated** - having folds that are permanently sewn into a piece of clothing

> Pleated skirts used to be very popular, but now plain skirts are more common.

**dressing room** - a small room with a mirror in a store where one can put on
clothing and see how it looks before deciding whether to buy it

> Please take only four pieces of clothing into the dressing room at a time.

**single-breasted** - a jacket that has buttons on only one side of the front, so that
when the jacket is closed one part goes over the other part, and only one column
(line) of buttons is showing

> Small women often wear single-breasted jackets with only one line of buttons.

**side vent** - a long, thin opening at the side and bottom of one's shirt or jacket
that allows one to move more easily

> Long jackets are easier to walk in if they have side vents.

**to dry clean** - to wash certain fabrics without using water done at a special
cleaning business

> If you wash your silk fabrics at home, you may destroy them. Why don't you
take them to be dry cleaned instead?

**fit** - being the correct size and shape for one's body

> This blouse isn't a very good fit, but the pants are great.

**vest** - clothing that is like a jacket, but without sleeves; a sleeve-less shirt that
buttons or zips in the front and is worn over another shirt

> Mr. Velazquez wore a gray suit with a white shirt and dark-blue vest.

**suspenders** - long, narrow pieces of cloth that attach to the front of one's pants,
go up over one's shoulders, and attach to the back of one's pants, to hold one's
pants up without using a belt

> Suspenders used to be very common, but now most men prefer to wear belts.

**garment bag** - a piece of fabric or plastic that zips around clothing on a hanger,
to protect it from getting dirty or folded

> When Damian flew to his job interview, he carried his business clothes in a
garment bag because he wanted to make sure they were in good condition when
he arrived.
