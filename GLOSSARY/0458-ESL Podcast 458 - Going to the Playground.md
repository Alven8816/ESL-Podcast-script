and make sure they don't get into trouble.

one's body

that is held up in the middle so that one child sits on each end and they use their
legs against the ground to push each other up into the air

how to come back down, so his brother had to help him.

**monkey bars** - a piece of equipment that looks like a ladder lying horizontally
with tall pieces of metal holding it up at each end, so that children can use their
hands to hang from the pieces of metal and move from one end to the other
without having their feet touch the ground

> Jake is already too tall for the monkey bars, so he has to bend his knees when
he hangs from them, or else his feet hit the ground.
