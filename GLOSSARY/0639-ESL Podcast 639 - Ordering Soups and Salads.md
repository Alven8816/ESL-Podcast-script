slices.

dressing with grated (small pieces of) Parmesan cheese and croutons (small
pieces of crunchy, fried bread), sometimes with chicken or shrimp on top

grilled chicken on top, it can be the main course.

**Cobb salad** - a type of salad that has many kinds of lettuce, chopped hard-
boiled egg, small pieces of ham and chicken, cheese, avocado, tomato, and
blue-cheese dressing

dressing at home, without buying a bottle of it at the store.

**vinaigrette** - a simple mixture of oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper that is put on
salad as a dressing

very strong taste and smell
