#### ESL Podcast 874 - Poor Road Conditions

**bicycle** - a device with two wheels, a seat, and a handlebar, that moves forward
when the rider balances and pushes the pedals (pieces under the feet) in a circle

> If everyone rode bicycles to work, we would have less traffic and less air
pollution.

**scenery** - views; what one sees in one's surroundings, especially when talking
about a beautiful natural area

> The hike is difficult, but the scenery from the top of the mountain makes it all
worthwhile.

**pothole** - a hole in the paved road, usually caused by a lot of traffic and very
cold temperatures

> The city doesn't have enough money to fix all the potholes, so local residents
are filling them with gravel and small rocks.

**asphalt** - a hard, black surface covering roads, usually made by mixing small
rocks with hot, sticky, oily substances

> On a hot summer day, the asphalt heats up so much that you could cook an
egg on it!

**cracked** - with small lines running through the surface of something where
pieces are separating, usually because something is breaking

> When Maggie goes grocery shopping, she always checks to make sure that
none of the eggs are cracked before she buys them.

**bumpy** - uneven; with many areas that are higher than the rest of the surface,
making for an uncomfortable ride

> When we drove grandpa home after his surgery, we tried to avoid all the bumpy
roads so that he wouldn't be in pain.

**gravel** - many small rocks, often used to cover a road that is not paved, or for
decoration in a yard

> The gravel roads in this area can get very dusty if it hasn't rained for a while, so
people tend to drive slowly and not follow other cars too closely.

**path** - route; a way to go between two points, especially one that is not paved
and is only for people who are walking or riding bicycles

> Can we follow this path to the lake?

**rut** - a long line made in a soft road, caused by many heavy vehicles traveling
over the same spot

> This path is hard to walk on because there are a lot of ruts from car tires.

**dip** - an area that is lower than the surrounding area, often because the surface
was built poorly and is sinking

> There's a big dip in the road near their home, and sometimes it becomes a
small pond after it has rained a lot.

**to lose control** - to no longer have power or influence over what happens or
how something or someone behaves

> A lot of drivers lose control of their car when driving on icy streets.

**slippery** - referring to something that is difficult to hold onto, possibly because it
is covered in oil, water, or ice

> Be careful walking on that wet floor. It's slippery!

**to swerve** - to turn quickly and unexpectedly, usually to avoid hitting something

> Did you see how that driver swerved to avoid hitting the dog in the road?

**paved** - with a hard, flat surface designed to make travel easier for cars,
bicycles, and other wheeled vehicles

> Areas with paved roads have a lot less dust in summertime.

**to bargain for** - to plan for; to expect something to be a certain way

> When we bought this house, we didn't bargain for the city to decide to put a
subway line along our street!

**road conditions** - a report of the weather and temperature and how they affect
driving, and/or an assessment of the quality of the road

> A lot of accidents occur under poor road conditions, especially at dawn and
dusk with heavy rain.

**crash helmet** - a protective hat that covers the top and sides of one's head, with
a connecting strap underneath the chin, designed to protect one's head and brain
from falls, especially when riding a motorcycle or bicycle

> If Jun hadn't been wearing a crash helmet, he probably would have died.

**to go flying** - to move very quickly through the air, especially when one is in an
accident

> It isn't safe to keep heavy objects inside your car, because they might go flying
and hit someone if you have to stop quickly.

**to break (one's) fall** - to cushion and protect someone from falling; to interrupt
one's fall so that one does not fall as hard and does not get hurt as badly

> The cat fell out of a third-story window, but fortunately, the canopy over the
door on the first floor broke its fall and it survived.
