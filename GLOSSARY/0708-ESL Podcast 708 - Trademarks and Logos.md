**competitor** - a company that sells products or services that are similar to those
sold by one's own company, so that both companies are trying to reach the same
buyers

> Whenever our company comes up with a new idea, our competitors copy it as
quickly as they can.

them apart!

without any text

**nothing alike** - completely different; not similar in any way

> Lynette and Michel have the same parents, but you'd never guess it, because
they are nothing alike.

**side by side** - with two things placed next to each other so that one can
compare and contrast them directly

performance side by side.

**trademark infringement** - a violation of the laws against using another
company's logo, brand name, or design for one's own company or other use

> When our competitor began using our logo and name, changing only one letter,
we sued the company for trademark infringement.

them exclusive rights to publish any of her future novels.

**trademark registry** - an official list of all the protected trademarks (words,

items on that list

submit it to the trademark registry.

**to nail (someone)** - to get someone in trouble and punish him or her for having
done something wrong

> If the professor sees us cheating on the exam, he'll nail us.

**to go back to the drawing board** - to begin something again; to give up on
what one had been working on or had recently completed and start over again,
usually because the first version wasn't good or appropriate

> An ad agency might spend months developing a campaign, but if the client
doesn't like it, they have to go back to the drawing board.

**literally** - referring to the actual, direct meaning of the words, not the symbolic
meaning of those words

literally.
