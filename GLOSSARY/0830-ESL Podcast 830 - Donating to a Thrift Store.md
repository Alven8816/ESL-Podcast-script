the trash

> Once a month, Heather checks the expiration date on everything in the fridge
and tosses food that isn't okay to eat.

**sentimental value** - the feeling of wanting to keep an object because of the

have the satisfaction of knowing that you're working for a good cause.

**tax deduction** - an amount of money that one is allowed to subtract from the
