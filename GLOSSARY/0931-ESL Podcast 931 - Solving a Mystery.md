#### ESL Podcast 931 - Solving a Mystery

**mystery** - something that is difficult to understand or determine, especially when
trying to determine who committed a crime

> Even now, 20 years after the murder, the identity of the murderer is still a
mystery.

**whodunit** - a story or movie about a murder that keeps the readers or audience
wondering who the murderer is until the very end

> This is such a great whodunit! I was so surprised to find out which character
was the murderer at the end of the book.

**clue** - a small piece of information that can be used with other pieces of
information to determine how or why something happened or who did it

> This trail of cookie crumbs is a good clue for finding out who ate all the cookies
I baked!

**detective** - a person whose job is to investigate crimes and determine who
committed them, often as part of a police force

> Detectives today use science to help them identify criminals.

**hunch** - a guess; a strong feeling that something is a certain way, even though
one does not have evidence and does not know for sure

> I have a hunch that they'll offer the job to you.

**lead** - clue; information that seems likely to help one find out what happened in a
crime, especially if that information is provided by someone else

> Hundreds of people have been calling the police station to provide leads for the
investigation.

**red herring** - distraction; something that diverts attention from what it should be
focused on, especially something that causes readers or viewers to incorrectly
believe that a certain person committed the crime

> The fact that Cynthia had stolen Erika's boyfriend years ago was just a red
herring, not really a motivation for murder, but the reader doesn't realize that until
the end of the film.

**alibi** - a person or thing that can prove that one was somewhere else, not where
the crime happened, at the time that the crime happened

> Shane says he was having dinner with his aunt at the time of the murder, so
he's using her as his alibi.

**witness** - a person who saw a crime happen and can talk about it during the
investigation and/or in a courtroom

> How many people were witnesses to the shooting?

**victim** - the person who is hurt or killed by an action; the person against whom a
crime is performed

> Yolanda was the victim of a hit-and-run accident, but fortunately, she didn't
have any major injuries.

**suspect** - a person whom investigators believe may have committed a crime,
but without any proof

> For now, the police are treating everyone in the building as a suspect.

**to have skeletons in (one's) closet** - to have secrets about what one has done
in the past, especially when those secrets are shameful, embarrassing, or bad,
and one is doing everything possible to prevent other people from finding out

> People who apply to work for the FBI or the CIA have to go through an
extensive interview process that tries to find out whether they have skeletons in
their closet.

**to get to the bottom of (something)** - to fully understand something and
identify the true cause or reason for it

> Nobody is sure why sales are falling, but we're going to get to the bottom of it.

**the rug gets pulled out from under (one)** - for one's support to be removed
suddenly and unexpectedly so that one no longer has anything to hold onto or
any idea to follow

> Paulina was a skiing champion preparing for the Winter Olympics, but the rug
got pulled out from under her when she broke her ankle.

**to keep (someone) guessing** - to make someone feel anticipation and
suspense, making them continue to wonder about something and not telling him
or her the answer

> Viktor says he has an exciting announcement to make, but he won't do it until
the whole family it together, so he's keeping us guessing.

**sensory overload** - the feeling of being a little bit overwhelmed and/or anxious
because one is receiving too much stimulation at one time, especially a
combination of loud noises, bright lights, and bright colors

> Going to an amusement park can be a lot of fun for older children, but it can
cause sensory overload for very young children.
