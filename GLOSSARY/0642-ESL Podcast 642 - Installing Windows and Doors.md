more than he could chew.

**do-it-yourself project** - a project that one does alone, without hiring
professionals, especially when referring to work done on or around one's home

them

**double-paned** - with two pieces of glass very close to each other, but with a
small amount of air in between, providing better protection from the weather and

something else

smoothness.

a picture frame

> Sheila bought a frame so that she could hang her diploma on the wall.

**screen** - a piece of wire or plastic netting with very small holes, hung behind a

let it be opened

**to get (something) out of the way** - to do something unpleasant immediately,
without delaying, so that one can then forget about it and focus on other things

evening.

to get dark

open or close
