**to take on** - to agree to accept a challenge; to start to do something that is very
difficult

> Are you sure you can take on another part-time job in addition to everything
else you're doing?

**to sell (oneself) short** - to underestimate one's abilities; to believe that one
cannot do something when one actually can

> Justin is trying to be humble during interviews, but he's really selling himself
short and employers don't realize what a talented manager he is.

**to have two left feet** - to be a very bad dancer; to be unable to use one's body
gracefully or elegantly

> Bjorn has always had two left feet on land, but he's a natural swimmer.

**uncoordinated** - not able to control the movements of one's body in a graceful,
purposeful way; not able to move one's arms and legs as one would like to,
especially not at the same time

> Lionel is a fast runner and has a strong arm, but he's too uncoordinated to be
on the basketball team.

**sense of rhythm** - one's ability to feel the beats (regular strong points) of a song
and move one's body or play an instrument in accordance with them

> Even as a preschooler, Adele had a great sense of rhythm and would play with
her toys as if they were drums whenever she heard music.

**cut out for** - prepared and qualified to do something; with the qualifications or
characteristics needed to do something well

> I like the idea of helping people, but I'm not cut out for being a doctor, because I
feel sick whenever I see blood.

**to get ahead of (oneself)** - to make plans or worry about what will happen in the
future before one has dealt with what needs to be done right now; to focus on the
future more than the present, especially when completing a task

> Wendy wants to pick out colors for new carpet and paint, but she's getting
ahead of herself, because we still have to save enough money to buy a house.

**to loosen up** - to relax and become less tense or stiff, especially in one's
muscles

> A massage, a warm bath, and a glass of wine can help anyone loosen up at the
end of a long week.

**to sway** - to gently and slowly move back and forth

> I love the sound of the leaves when tree branches sway in the wind.

**to swing (one's) hips** - to purposefully move one's hips (the side of one's body
above the leg and below one's waist), usually while dancing

> When we were in Hawaii, we watched hula dancers who are very good at
swinging their hips to make the grass skirts move.

**dance step** - individual movements with one's feet while dancing; how one is
supposed to move one's feet and body while dancing

> The dance teacher is teaching the dancers some exciting new dance steps.

**dance routine** - a memorized series of dance steps used to dance to a
particular piece of music as part of a performance; choreography

> The elementary school students are learning a dance routine for the holiday
performance.

**down the line** - later; in the future; eventually

> Down the line, I'd like to become fluent in Mandarin, but for now, I'd be happy
just to be able to say "hello" and "good-bye"!

**pipe dream** - a plan or dream that is impossible and cannot be achieved

> Owning her own salon seems like a pipe dream, but Hanan keeps saving her
money.

**nonsense** - a word used to show that one does not believe what another person
has said, and that it has no meaning or logic

> Did he really say that? That's nonsense! Don't believe a word of it.

**effortless** - easy; without trying

> Gustavo makes flying an airplane look effortless, but I know he's had a lot of
hours of training.

**hippo** - hippopotamus; a large, hairless animal with a big belly, very short legs,
and a big head that spends most of its time in the water, often used to describe
people who are not graceful or elegant

> Traci has always been slender, but she says she felt like a hippo while she was
pregnant with twins.
