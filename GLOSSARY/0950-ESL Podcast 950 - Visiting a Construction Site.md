#### ESL Podcast 950 - Visiting a Construction Site

**construction site** - an area where people are creating a new building

> The small businesses around the construction site have been complaining that
they're losing business, because customers can't park on the street when so
many machines are there.

**scaffolding** - a temporary structure made from metal and wood, used to help
workers reach the higher parts of a building to build, repair, or clean it

> I'll stand on the second level of the scaffolding, and you can pass the bricks up
to me in this bucket.

**to come along** - to progress, advance, or move forward; to make progress

> Wow, the project is really coming along. Well done!

**lumber** - wood that has been cut into specific sizes to use in construction

> What kind of lumber do you need: two-by-fours or two-by-eights?

**brick** - a small, rectangular block, usually dark red and made from clay, used to
build walls or chimneys

> Do you prefer brick fireplaces or stone fireplaces?

**foundation** - the part of a building that touches the ground and supports the rest
of the building

> Was the home's foundation damaged in the flood?

**beam** - a long, straight piece of wood or metal used to support the wall or roof of
a building

> I don't know if the beams can support the weight of so much snow on the roof.

support and give shape to the roof

> Most of the ceiling is painted a cream color, but the rafters are still unpainted
wood.

construction sites

danger

**pickaxe** - a large, heavy tool with a wooden handle and a large piece of metal at
the other end with two sharp ends, usually used to tear apart earth or rocks

> If you want to plant a garden here, we'll need a pickaxe to get rid of all the
grass and rocks.

used to dig into the ground and scoop (lift) up dirt and rocks

> Do you have a special shovel for clearing the snow off the sidewalk?

**wheelbarrow** - a car with two wheels and one or two supporting legs at the
other end, used to carry heavy objects when pushed by a person

> They filled the wheelbarrow with small rocks and pushed it into the backyard,
where they were creating a new path.

**to escort (someone)** - to take someone somewhere; to accompany and guide
someone to a particular place

**bulldozer** - a large vehicle that has a flat but slightly curved piece of metal in the
front that can be raised and lowered, used to push dirt and rocks

> The bulldozer will push the extra rocks and soil out of the way so that we can
begin pouring concrete.

hook attached to a large rope hanging from the top of a long arm or beam
