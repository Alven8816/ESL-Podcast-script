#### ESL Podcast 1028 - Describing Order and Sequence

**task** - job; project; some piece of work that must be completed

> One of the assistant's tasks is to keep the copier and fax machine stocked with
paper and ink.

**to put (something) in order** - to move things so that they are logically arranged
and organized, making it easy to find specific items later

> Please put these bills and account statements in order for our records.

**storeroom** - warehouse; a large room used primarily for placing objects until
they are needed in the future

> The storeroom is filled with extra inventory and office supplies.

**filing system** - a logical, organized way to store pieces of paper or digital files,
grouping related items so that they can be found easily later

> In this filing system, pink folders are used for human resources, yellow folders
are used for sales contracts, and blue folders are used for financial statements.

**sequence** - order, often with the earliest things first and the latest things last

> The police are interviewing witnesses to try to understand the sequence of
events before the murder.

**labeled** - with a tag or sticker that identifies something, providing basic
information about it

> Each of these folders is labeled with the patient's name, gender, and date of
birth.

**chronological order** - with the earliest things first and the most recent things
last; ordered by date

> Telling stories is easy if you put the events in chronological order so that
listeners can understand what happened first and what happened next.

**alphabetical order** - arranged like the letters of the alphabet, with items starting
with A listed first, and items starting with Z listed last

> On the first day of school, the teacher asked the students to sit in alphabetical
order by their last names.

**digit** - one written number, from 0 to 9

> Phone numbers have 10 digits, including a three-digit area code.

**ascending** - listed in order with the smallest values first and the largest values
last; listed in order from smallest to largest

> When we sort the monthly sales in ascending order, it became clear that our
worst performance is always in February.

**descending** - listed in order with the largest values first and the smallest values
last; listed in order from largest to smallest

> The tax forms require listing all the employees with their salaries in descending
order, so the CEO should be at the top of the list.

**numeric** - related to numbers, not letters

> The participants evaluated the workshop on a numeric scale, where 5 meant
"excellent" and 1 meant "very poor."

**order** - a logical way of sorting items so that they are arranged in a predictable
way

> The bookkeeper requests that we present the receipts in some sort of order, not
just thrown into an envelope for her to sort through.

**alphanumeric order** - arranged and organized with respect to the letters and
numbers contained in something

> Wouldn't it be strange if people had alphanumeric codes instead of names?

**random** - selected based on chance and therefore unpredictable; with an equal
probability of all outcomes occurring; not ordered, logical, or predictable

> The teacher grouped the students randomly, rather than by age.

**to embrace** - to welcome something with a lot of enthusiasm or joy

> Does everyone in your company embrace new technology?

**chaos** - disorder; a complete lack of organization and logical order

> Justin's office is total chaos. How can he get any work done if he can't find the
documents he needs?
