**to hear back** - to receive communication from someone after one has left a

> I've left seven messages on Alexey's cell phone in the past 24 hours, but I still
haven't heard back from him. Do you think he's avoiding me?

**maintenance** - the work or actions needed to keep something in good condition,
or at least to avoid letting it fall into worse condition

much maintenance it would require.

presentation. But since she hasn't complained, let's give the team the benefit of
the doubt.

**all the while** - while; simultaneously; at the same time, especially when used to
show a strong contrast

another person to pay attention, listen carefully, and remember it in the future

he or she leaves a place
