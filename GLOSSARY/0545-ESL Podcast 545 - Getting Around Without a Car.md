#### ESL Podcast 545 - Getting Around Without a Car

**to have got (something) covered** - to have something under control; to be in
control of a situation; to know how to handle or deal with a situation

> Yes, there's a lot of work to do by Friday, but don't worry. Insley says he's got it
covered.

**skateboard** - a flat, rectangular board with rounded ends connected to four
small wheels, so that a person can move quickly by standing on it, pushing one's
foot against the ground to increase speed and change direction

> Vinny's mother won't let him ride his skateboard unless he wears a helmet.

**dirt road** - an unpaved road; a road that is covered with rocks or dirt instead of
asphalt or concrete

> It's almost impossible to drive down that dirt road during the rainy season
because it gets too muddy.

**no big thing** - no big deal; not important; not something that one is worried
about

> Hideako lost $30,000 in the stock market, but it's no big thing. He has millions.

**bike** - bicycle; a type of transportation with two wheels and a seat, where one
moves by pedaling (moving one's feet in a circle to turn the wheels)

> If you ride your bike to the grocery store, how will you carry home your
groceries?

**rollerblades** - special shoes with a single line of wheels on the bottom, much
like roller skates

> On the weekends, Caitlin likes to wear her rollerblades to the park.

**Segway** - an electric machine with two wheels and a small flat area to stand on,
used for transporting one person, with the person standing on it and controlling
the speed and direction with the movement of one's body

> We were surprised to see security guards riding Segways at the mall, but I
guess they can move around more quickly and easily on a Segway than by
walking.

**in the meantime** - while something else is happening; until something else
happens

> I ordered a new jacket online, but it won't arrive until next week. In the
meantime, I'll just have to keep wearing this old one.

**worst case scenario** - the worst possible situation; a phrase used to describe
the most negative, unpleasant thing that might happen

> Go ahead and buy the new car. Worst case scenario, if you can't make the
payments, you can always sell it to someone else.

**to commute** - to travel between one's home and workplace

> Bouvier has a one-hour commute, but because he takes the train, he can spend
that time reading and making phone calls.

**to fess up** - to confess; to tell the truth; to say something that one would rather
keep a secret

> Fess up! You went into my room and looked through my things, didn't you?

**well-being** - one's physical, mental, and emotional health

> My wife keeps telling me: If want to improve your well-being, start taking better
care of yourself. Eat right, exercise, and get enough sleep.

**ulterior motive** - a secret reason for wanting to do something, especially when
one is pretending to want to do it for another reason

> Xavier is encouraging his older sister to get a tattoo, and he says he's doing it
because he knows she wants one, but his ulterior motive is that he wants one
too, and he thinks their parents will let him do it once she has already done it.

**scooter** - a small motorcycle that isn't very powerful, or a flat, rectangular board
with rounded ends connected to four small wheels and with a tall handle for one
to hold onto, so that a person can move quickly by standing on it, using one's
foot against the ground to increase speed and change direction

> On sunny days, all the little kids on our street ride scooters up and down the
sidewalks.

**next to nothing** - almost nothing; almost free; for a very small amount of money

> Eve bought a home for next to nothing, because it's right next to the airport and
no one else wanted to live in such a noisy place.

**to pawn off** - to get rid of something by selling it, especially if that thing has very
little value or worth

> I can't believe you were able to pawn off that ugly old boat that doesn't even
float. Who did you sell it to?

**to look out for (someone's) best interest** - to do what is best for another
person; to help another person

> Mitch has always looked out for my best interest, inviting me to professional
conferences and letting me know about interesting job opportunities.

**con artist** - a person who makes money by tricking other people, making them
think they are doing something to help themselves when it actually helps the con
artist

> The police are trying to find the con artist who's been calling elderly people,
pretending to call from the bank and getting them to share their account
information so he can steal their money.
