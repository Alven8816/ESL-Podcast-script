#### ESL Podcast 606 - Reading a Bus Schedule

**bus schedule** - written information about where buses go and stop, how often,
and at what times

> According to this bus schedule, there isn't any bus service on Sundays.

**route number** - the number assigned to all buses that follow a certain path

> Route numbers 14, 28, and 59 pass by the university.

**stop** - a place where a bus stops for a short period of time to let passengers get
on and off

> Start gathering your things. We'll get off at the next stop.

**column** - information printed vertically (not horizontally) in a table; words or
numbers that are printed above and below each other (not side by side)

> This table of sales data has one column for sales in each of the past five years.

**to work backwards** - to solve a problem or answer a question by starting with
the end result and using logic to find what must have been true at the beginning

> If we know we have $360 in the cash register and we've made $200 in sales so
far today, then we can work backwards to figure out that we started the day with
$160 in the cash register.

**starting point** - where someone or something begins; the initial location or
situation

> Yes, I'd be happy to give you directions to our store, but first I need to know
where your starting point is. Will you becoming from the north or south?

**directly** - moving in a line that is as straight as possible between points A and B,
without going to any other places

> Their kids are supposed to come home directly from school, but sometimes
they stop at the candy store first.

**transfer** - a piece of paper that is given to a passenger by a bus driver and
allows that passenger to get on another bus without paying for a certain period of
time, usually a few hours

> If you ride the subway, be sure to get a transfer so that you can take a bus to
your final destination without needing to pay again.

**to take (something) into account** - to consider something; to include
something as a factor in one's decision

> When deciding whether you can afford to stay home with the kids, take into
account all the added expenses of working outside the home, like transportation,
professional clothing, dry cleaning, and lunches at restaurants.

**peak** - when something is busiest or most heavily used

> Many doctors' offices experience peak call volume on Monday mornings, so
they recommend that their patients call at other times if possible.

**commuter** - a person who is traveling between his or her home and workplace

> Ryan hates wasting time as a commuter, so he is looking for an apartment
downtown so he can walk to and from the office.

**bus pass** - a small card or other piece of paper that allows one to ride the bus a
certain number or an unlimited number of times during a certain period of time,
often one month

> Since we ride the bus at least twice each day, it's cheaper for us to buy a
monthly bus pass than to pay for individual tickets.

**exact change** - coins and/or bills that add up to the price or cost of something,
so that one does not need to receive any money in return

> Riding the bus costs $1.90 and requires exact change, so if you only have two
$1 bills, there's no way to get the extra $0.10 back.

**fare** - the cost of riding a bus or some other form of transportation

> The city is going to increase bus fares to cover the rising cost of gas.

**to board** - to get on a bus, train, boat, or plane

> The flight is scheduled to leave at 3:45, so we should start boarding around
3:20.
