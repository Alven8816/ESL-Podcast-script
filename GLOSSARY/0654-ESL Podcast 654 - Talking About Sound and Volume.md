#### ESL Podcast 654 - Talking About Sound and Volume

**to turn (something) up/down** - to increase or decrease the volume, especially
of music or television

> Could you please turn the TV up? I can't hear what the reporter is saying.

**ear-splitting** - hurting one's ears because something is extremely loud and/or
high-pitched

> When Raffi heard an ear-splitting scream in the middle of the night, he
immediately called the police.

**to concentrate** - to focus all of one's attention on one thing, without being
distracted by other things

> Patrizia is having a lot of problems in her personal life and that makes it difficult
for her to concentrate on her work.

**to swear** - to insist that one is telling the truth; to very strongly state that one is
being honest

> I don't know who ate the last piece of cake, but I swear it wasn't me!

**volume control** - a small dial or knob on a radio, stereo, television, or other
piece of electronic equipment, touched to make something louder or quieter

> This volume control is really sensitive, so even the gentlest touch makes a big
difference in how loud the music is.

**decibel** - a measurement of how loud something is

> The noise in a typical library is around 40 decibels, but the noise created by a
jet airplane taking off is around 120 decibels.

**high-pitched** - with a very high sound, more like a soprano woman's voice than
like a bass man's voice

> Why do so many cartoon characters have annoyingly high-pitched voices?

**squeal** - a loud, high sound, often made when one is very happy or excited

> Their home is always filled with squeals of laughter.

**speaker** - the part of a radio, stereo, or television set that produces noise

> We had a great time sitting right in front of the speakers at the concert last
night, but today my ears hurt and it's hard to hear anything.

**grating** - making an annoying, unpleasant sound; irritating; bothering someone;
making someone angry and upset

> The beeping sound at the grocery store every time someone buys something is
really grating. I wouldn't want to work there.

**banging** - with a loud, heavy sound that lasts for a very short period of time,
usually produced when two objects hit each other, or when one object falls

> People say that bears are scared of banging noises, so it's a good idea to hit
two sticks together when you're walking alone in the woods.

**hammer** - a tool with a wooden handle and a heavy metal top, used to hit nails
and push them into a wall or a piece of wood

> You'll need a hammer and a screwdriver to assemble this bookcase.

**thumping** - a loud, slightly muffled or distant noise caused when something falls
or when two heavy objects hit each other

> Whenever our neighbor practices the drums, we can hear the thumping noises
in our home, even though we live one block away!

**to lift weights** - to try to build one's strength and/or the size of one's muscles by
lifting heavy objects many times

> Studies have shown that older people who lift weights a few times each week
are less likely to break their bones in a fall.

**moderate** - of medium size or number; not too big and not too small; not too
loud and not too quiet

> We've seen a moderate decrease in the unemployment rate, but not as much
as people were hoping for

**quiet as a mouse** - extremely quiet, not making any noise

> Everyone became as quiet as a mouse, waiting to hear the important
announcement.
