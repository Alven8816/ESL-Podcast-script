#### ESL Podcast 637 - Planting Flowers and Trees

**to plant** - to put seeds or plants into the ground so that they can grow, usually to
produce food or to make an area more beautiful

> Thirty years ago, we planted a small maple tree in front of our home, and now
it's beautiful and at least 20 feet tall.

**garden** - an area of land used for growing plants, either for food or for beauty

> Reynosa picked lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers from her garden to make a
salad.

**fertilizer** - a substance that makes soil (earth; dirt) better and more nutritious for
plants, often made from animal feces (solid waste) or chemicals like nitrogen and
phosphorous

> Our plants would grow more quickly and be healthier if we put some fertilizer in
the soil.

**to get to (someone)** - to bother or annoy someone, especially after a period of
time

> All the news stories about homeless people are starting to get to me. I think we
should volunteer and do something to help.

**weed** - an unwanted plant; an undesirable plant that should be removed from an
area

> Our rose garden has so many weeds that we almost can't see the flowers!

**soil** - dirt; earth; the substance on the ground outdoors that plants can grow in

> Do we need to buy special soil for these flowers, or can we just plant them in
front of the house?

**to dig** - to make a hole in the earth, usually by using a shovel (a tool) to move
soil

> The dog dug a hole near the tree and buried its bone there.

**hole** - an open area with nothing in it, surrounded by something else

> Watch where you step! There are a lot of holes in the sidewalk and you could
hurt yourself if you fell into one.

**seed** - the small piece of a plant that has all the genetic information needed for a
new plant to grow

> The little girl's mother taught her not to eat the seeds when she eats an apple.
She should spit them out.

**flower** - a beautiful, colorful part of a plant, usually with many small pieces, that
a plant uses to attract insects like bees, and that people give to each other as
gifts

> Melissa had beautiful flowers at her wedding ceremony: hydrangea, roses, and
tulips.

**pot** - a plastic or ceramic container, usually round, without a top that is filled with
soil and plants, used either indoors or outdoors

> Winnie grows mint, oregano, basil, and other herbs in small pots by her kitchen
window.

**left** - remaining; still available

> A lot of food was left after the party, so Camden asked his guests to take some
of it home with them.

**deep** - with a long distance below the surface; going far below something

> If you don't know how to swim very well, stay out of the deep end of the pool.

**root** - one of the parts of a plant that is below ground and not seen, used to
bring water and nutrients out of the soil and into the plant

> If we want to get rid of those blackberry plants, we need to make sure we pull
out all the roots. Otherwise they'll just grow back again.

**to grow** - for a living thing to become bigger and older over time

> I can't believe how much your children have grown since the last time I saw
them!

**direct sunlight** - with sunshine falling on something; with exposure to the sun
that is not blocked by anything else

> Those plants will probably die in direct sunshine. It would be better to plant
them in the shade under a tree.

**to water** - to put a small amount of water on or near a plant so that it will
continue to live and grow

> How often do you water your houseplants?

**to supervise** - to manage; to watch how someone is doing something and give
recommendations, instructions, and orders for doing it better

> Nathan spends a lot of time supervising his new employees, but once they
prove that they know what they're doing, he lets them work independently.
