#### ESL Podcast 397 - Being a Divorced Parent

**single parent** - a mother or father who is raising a child alone, without the help
of the other parent, usually because the parents never married or are divorced,
or because one parent died

> As a single parent, Amanda has to act as both the mother and father for her
children.

**civil** - polite; not rude, but not friendly either

> Ingrid is always very civil to her colleagues, but she is never very friendly
toward them.

**joint custody** - a legal arrangement made during a divorce where each parent
agrees to live with the child for a certain amount of time each year

> They have joint custody of their son: he lives with his mom during the week and
with his dad on holidays and most weekends.

**quality time** - time that is spent with another person, really paying attention to
each other and enjoying each other's company

> They spend a lot of time together, but it isn't really quality time because they're
usually just watching TV.

**adjustment** - a change; an adaptation to a new situation; getting used to a new
situation

> Learning how to use the new version of this software program has been a
difficult adjustment for me.

**visitation rights** - the rules regarding when a parent can see his or her child
while the child is staying in the other parent's home

> If you keep using drugs, you will lose your visitation rights and never see your
daughter again!

**If you don't mind my asking...** - a polite phrase used when one wants to know
something that normally isn't shared because it is too private or personal

> If you don't mind my asking, how much money do you make?

**financially** - related to money, especially how much money one has or how
much money one spends

> We're doing well financially, with enough money saved up to send Jenny to a
good four-year university.

**alimony** - a payment, usually monthly, made from one spouse to another after a
divorce so that he or she has enough money to live comfortably

> Raheem has to pay $1,700 in alimony to his ex-wife each month.

**child support** - a payment, usually monthly, made from one spouse to another
after a divorce so that he or she has enough money to raise the children

> Does your ex-husband send you enough child support to buy clothes and food
for the kids?

**objection** - a reason that one states for not doing something, or for not wanting
to do something

> A vacation in Hawaii would be wonderful, but my only objection is that I think it
will be too expensive.

**amenable** - willing to do something; thinking that something is a good idea

> I'm amenable to doing whatever you want to do on our date tomorrow night.

**to act out** - to behave poorly, usually to get attention; to misbehave

> Ever since his mom died, Charlie has been acting out in school, fighting with
the other students.

**supportive** - helpful; providing assistance and guidance; helping someone in a
difficult situation

> Wendy was very supportive when Blake had cancer, always visiting him and
cooking for him.

**stability** - the condition of not changing; the condition of always being the same
or similar

> We have to stop moving so much! The kids need more stability in their lives.

**under the circumstances** - given the current situation; considering all the
factors

> Normally that home would have sold for $550,000, but the housing market is
falling, so under the circumstances I think they were lucky to have sold it for
$480,000.
