**chance** - probability; likelihood; a measure of how likely it is that something will
happen

> What are the chances that they'll have another girl when they already have four
daughters?

**fifty-fifty** - with two possible outcomes that are equally likely; equally likely to
have either result

> The weather reporter said there's a fifty-fifty chance of rain tomorrow.

**fat chance** - an informal phrase used to mean that something is very unlikely,
almost impossible

> Fat chance that Drake will apologize. He still thinks he did nothing wrong.

**to stake (one's) life on (something)** - to be completely sure about something;
to so strong believe that something will happen that one is willing to die if one is
not right

> I believe she'll will the election. In fact, I'd stake my life on it.

**to exaggerate** - to make something seem more extreme that it really is,
especially to make something seem bigger or worse than it really is

> Gerald said he has 10 sports cars, but I think he was just exaggerating.

**irresponsible** - not responsible or accountable; careless and not worried about
the negative consequences of one's actions

> Olga is an irresponsible driver. I would never let her drive my car.

**probability** - likelihood; odds; a measure of how likely it is that something will
happen

> If you fill a hat with seven yellow balls and four blue balls, and then close your
eyes and take out one ball, what's the probability that you'll pick a blue ball?

**intention** - what one meant to do or what one planned to do, but not necessarily
what actually happened

> Our intention was to help, not to make the situation even worse.

**to lose track of time** - to not pay attention to what time it is and not realize how
much time has already passed, especially when one has an obligation or
commitment at a particular time

> Heather and her girlfriends were having so much fun that they lost track of time
and didn't get home until almost 4:30 a.m.

**follow-through** - an attempt to do what one has promised to do or what one is
expected to do

> Yuki has a lot of great ideas, but I won't get too excited until I see her follow-
through during implementation.

**on (one's) way** - en route; coming or going to a particular destination, but not
yet having arrived

> Please don't start the meeting without me. I'm on my way and I should be there
in just a few minutes.

**to not hold (one's) breath** - to not stop breathing while waiting for something to
happen, meaning that something will not happen for a long time, if it ever
happens at all

> We all hope the economy will start to improve, but we aren't holding our breath.

**when hell freezes over** - an expression used to show that one does not believe
something will ever happen

> Sure, he'll pay back the money when hell freezes over.

**wee bit** - a little bit or a tiny amount, especially when used sarcastically because
someone is actually talking about a large amount

> The contractors said the project was a wee bit over budget, but it's actually
more than seven million dollars over budget!

**cynical** - doubtful; not believing something, especially not believing in the
goodness of other people

> When the government does bad things like that, it makes people cynical about
politicians and their promises.

**to indulge in wishful thinking** - to make oneself feel happy or content with
optimistic thoughts, assuming that only good things will happen; believing that
something will happen as one wants it to happen

> Adam is convinced his business will succeed, but given how many of his
competitors have failed, it seems like he's indulging in wishful thinking.

**to eat (one's) words** - to be forced to admit (say) that one was wrong about
something, especially when doing so is embarrassing

> Justin never believed his sister would be able to lose the weight, but she did,
and now he has to eat his words.
