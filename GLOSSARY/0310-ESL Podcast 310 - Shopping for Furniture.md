#### ESL Podcast 310 - Shopping for Furniture

**furniture** - large things that are put inside one's home or office to make it more
comfortable and/or easier to live or work in

> Maude's bedroom has only three pieces of furniture: a bed, a small table, and
one chair.

**to do the trick** - to meet one's need; to be good, fast, or big enough; to be
satisfactory

> Becky's bicycle made loud squeaks when she rode it, but putting a little bit of oil
on the wheels did the trick, and now it doesn't make any noise at all.

**to match** - to have the same color and style so that something looks good next
to something else

> Does this shirt match these pants?

**dining chair** - a chair put next to a table and used to sit on while eating

> Their dining chairs are very uncomfortable so they never spend very much time
talking around the table after they finish eating.

**dining table** - a large table that holds plates, silverware, and food while people
are eating

> We like having dinner parties, so we have a large dining table that has room for
10 people.

**hand-me-down** - used; things that are used by another person and then given
to oneself, because they can still be used, even though they aren't new

> Todd wears hand-me-down clothes that used to belong to his older brothers.

**dresser** - a piece of furniture with drawers that are used to store folded clothing

> I use the small dresser drawers for socks and underwear, and the large dresser
drawers for pants, t-shirts, and sweaters.

**nightstand** - a small, short table that is placed next to a bed

> Christophe keeps a small lamp, his favorite book, and a glass of water on his
nightstand.

**headboard** - the large piece of wood that stands next to the wall and is attached
to the end of the bed where one rests one's head

> Danielle's parents bought her a new bed and put up a large wooden headboard
with flowers painted on it.

**wardrobe** - a large piece of furniture that has doors that open so that clothes
can be hung inside

> Bjorn's room doesn't have a closet, so he bought a wardrobe where he can
hang his suits.

**bed** - a piece of furniture that one sleeps on

> We stayed in a hotel with very uncomfortable beds, so we weren't able to sleep
well that night.

**couch** - a long, soft piece of furniture that is put in the living room for three or
more people to sit on

> Alicia didn't feel well, so she spent all afternoon sitting on the couch and
watching TV.

**love seat** - a piece of soft furniture that is put in the living room for one person to
sit on, or for two people to sit on very close to each other

> Dana and her boyfriend like to sit on the love seat, so that they can be very
close to each other.

**coffee table** - a long, short table that is placed in front of a couch or love seat

> I set your cup of tea on the coffee table a few minutes ago. I hope it's not cold
already.

**side table** - a small table that is placed at one end of a couch or love seat

> Richard keeps interesting magazines on his side tables in the living room.

**table lamp** - a small lamp (light) that is placed on a table, usually next to a
couch or bed

> Ita keeps a table lamp on the nightstand next to her bed, so that she can read
before she falls asleep.

**floor lamp** - a tall lamp (light) that rests on the floor and reaches toward the
ceiling

> This room doesn't have any lights built into the ceiling, so we bought a few floor
lamps to provide light.

**to entertain** - to invite other people to one's house to eat, drink, and have fun
together

> Martha likes to entertain, so she often invites people over to eat dinner at her
house.
