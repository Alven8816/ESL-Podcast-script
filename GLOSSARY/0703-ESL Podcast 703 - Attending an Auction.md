#### ESL Podcast 703 - Attending an Auction

**auction** - an event or place where things are sold to the person who is willing to
pay the most for them

on the pieces.

**auctioneer** - a person whose job is to lead an auction, announcing what is for
sale and identifying who is willing to pay the most money

> If you want to buy something, make sure the auctioneer can see and hear you.

**podium** - a small raised area that is a little higher than the surrounding floor,
where a speaker stands so that he or she can be seen by the audience, and/or a
wooden stand the speaker stands behind and places books or notes on so that
he or she can read the notes while facing and speaking to the audience

speeds up, and his hands begin to sweat.

**bidding** - the process of many people taking turns announcing how much they
are willing to pay for something until only one person is willing to pay the final
price

money than they had planned.

**reserve** - the minimum price at which something will be sold

reserve was $7,500.

**opening bid** - the amount proposed by the auctioneer to begin bidding on a
particular item, so that the first bid is equal to that amount and all other bids must
be higher

> If the opening bid is too low, the bidding process can take a long time.

at an auction

they're bidding on?

a particular place and time to participate in some meeting or activity

**paddle** - a flat round or square piece of wood or plastic with a handle, held in the
air with one's hand, usually marked with a large number so that one can place a
bid at an auction

> If the auctioneer sees your paddle in the air, she'll assume you're bidding on
the item she's talking about.

**going, going, gone** - a phrase used by an auctioneer when he or she thinks
only one person is still bidding, indicating that the opportunity to bid will end and
nobody else will be able to buy something

> I hear $235. Is that the final bid? Going, going, gone to the lady in the blue hat.

**commission** - the percentage of a sales price that one receives for helping to
sell something

shoppers make a purchase.

what one is asking, or there will be negative, unspecified consequences

of wood that used to be used when cutting someone's neck to separate the head
from the body
