#### ESL Podcast 938 - Learning to Ride the Subway

**subway** - a system of underground trains, usually in a large city

> Leona rides the subway to work every day.

**ticket machine** - a machine that sells tickets, especially tickets used to ride a
bus, train, or boat

> Use the ticket machine to buy all-day passes: two for adults and three for
children.

**ticket window** - a desk where people can purchase tickets from a cashier while
the two are separated by a large piece of glass

> Why do movie theaters use ticket windows? Wouldn't it be friendlier if the
cashier and the customers were face-to-face?

**fare** - the amount of money paid for a ride or a trip on a particular type of
transportation; the cost of being transported on one type of transportation from
one place to another

> The city wants to raise the bus fare from $1.65 to $1.95, and people are really
upset about it.

**train** - a vehicle with many cars connected together, where each car has wheels
that rest on long metal strips on the ground, with a pre-defined route

> Sorry we're late, but we had to stop while a really long train passed through
town.

**turnstile** - a device that turns when pushed and allows only one person at a time
to pass through an entry way, usually to control who can enter and/or to count
the number of people who pass through

> The turnstiles are too narrow for people who have strollers and people who use
wheelchairs, so they get to go around them.

**slot** - a small, flat opening, especially for a coin, a ticket, or a piece of paper

> Don't forget to take your debit card out of the slot when you're done using the
ATM!

**to retrieve** - to get something back; to collect something that was temporarily
somewhere else

> The computer crashed. Do you think I'll be able to retrieve the document I was
working on?

**line** - one of many routes in a bus or train system

> Take the purple line to the Main Square, and then take the orange line out to
our neighborhood.

**station** - a place where people get on and off of busses or trains, and where
they wait for the bus or train they need to take

> Is this the bus station where I can catch a bus to Cleveland?

**transfer** - permission to switch from one type of transportation to another without
paying again

> Keep your bus ticket in your pocket, because you can use it as a transfer to
another bus line for the next two hours.

**connecting** - a second bus, train, or airplane that allows one to continue one's
trip to the ultimate destination

> It looks like we're going to have to be at the airport for more than three hours
while we wait for our connecting flight.

**express** - faster than regular types of transportation, with few or no stops
between the most important places

> I wish there were an express train connecting Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Portland, and Seattle!

**local** - slower than some other types of transportation, with many stops every
few blocks

> If we take the local bus, it could take up to two hours to get to City Hall. Can't
we just drive instead?

**station agent** - a person whose job is to give directions, help people purchase
tickets, tell people which way to go, and maintain safety and cleanliness in the
transportation system

> During the summer months, the city has to hire additional station agents to
handle all the tourists' questions.

**platform** - the flat, raised area where people sit and stand while waiting for a
bus or train to arrive

> Please stay behind the yellow line on the train platform so that you don't get hit
by the side of the train.

**tracks** - the long, parallel pieces of metal that a train's wheels travel upon

> If the engineer goes too quickly around that curve, the train could jump off its
tracks.
