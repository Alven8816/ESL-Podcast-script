#### ESL Podcast 537 - Types of Bank Accounts

**savings account** - a bank account designed to hold the money that one has
saved and pay the owner a small percentage, so that the money can be used for
special, important purchases in the future

> If we buy that expensive new car, we'll have to use most of the money in our
savings account.

**checking account** - a bank account designed to hold a smaller amount of
money that can be accessed many times each day to make small purchases with
a debit card or with a check

> Do we have enough money in our checking account to pay the phone bill this
month?

**CD** - certificate of deposit; a bank account designed to hold a large amount of
money for a certain period of time during which it will not be touched, and
designed to pay the owner a percentage of that money

> They have a lot of extra cash, but they're too scared to invest in the stock
market, so they're going to open a CD instead.

**interest-earning** - describing an account that pays the owner a percentage of
the amount of money in the account

> I have an interest-earning account, but it pays less than one percent.

**free checking** - a checking account that the owner can have and use without
paying the bank for it; a checking account with no monthly fees or check-printing
fees

> Free checking accounts are great, but you still have to pay fines if you write
checks when you don't have enough money in the bank.

**service charge** - an amount of money charged by a bank for a service, such as
using an ATM or speaking with a bank employee

> We couldn't believe it when the bank started charging a $3 service fee each
time we went in to do our transactions.

**minimum balance** - the minimum amount of money that one must keep in a
bank account in order to keep it open and/or avoid a monthly charge

> We offer a free savings account as long as you maintain a minimum balance of
$600.

**to dip below** - to fall below a certain number or amount; to be less than a certain
number or amount

> We'll get a loan as soon as the interest rate dips below 5.35%.

**to link** - to connect; to tie two or more things together in some way

> A company's financial success is closely linked to the quality of its employees.

**overdraft protection** - a service through which a bank honors (pays money for)
one's checks even when one has written a check without having enough money
in one's bank account to cover it

> If you keep enough money in your bank account, you shouldn't ever need to
use overdraft protection

**in case** - in the event that; in a particular situation; a phrase used to talk about
something that one is doing to protect oneself if something else should happen

> You better take an umbrella just in case it rains.

**to bounce (a check)** - to write a check when one doesn't have enough money in
one's bank account to cover the amount; to write a bad check

> The landlord was really angry when we bounced our rent check.

**joint account** - an account with two or more equal owners

> Even though they've been married for 13 years, they still don't have a joint
account at the bank. They prefer to manage their money separately.

**to pool** - to combine things; to put everything in one group or account

> Hitoshi is a great cook, and Yuki is a great baker, so they're pooling their talents
to open a new restaurant.

**to lock in** - to agree on an interest rate or another number that will not change
over time

> They're offering to lock in the price over three years, as long as we buy at least
7,500 units.

**interest rate** - the percentage of money that one must pay when borrowing
money, or that one receives when putting one's money in a bank

> This is a great time to buy a house because interest rates are really low.

**to mature** - for a financial arrangement to reach the end of a specified period of
time so that it is ready to be paid

> Let's buy some bonds that will mature on Craig's 18th
birthday, so that he can
use the money for college.

**to interfere** - to become involved in someone else's business or personal
affairs, especially when that person doesn't want one's help or involvement

> I know you were trying to help, but I really wish you hadn't interfered. I could
have done it alone.
