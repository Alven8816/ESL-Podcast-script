have any furniture

long.

or shorter.

**keyboard tray** - a small, flat piece of wood or metal underneath the top of a
desk that holds a keyboard and rolls out when one wants to type, but then can be
pushed back under the desk when one does not want to use the keyboard

install it with just a few screws.

furniture, like a desk or dresser

second drawer, and computer cables are in the bottom drawer.

**lateral files** - files and folders that are stored in a wide drawer so that they all
face toward the right or left of the piece of furniture, not toward the person who
opens the drawer

and the newest files are on the right.

chosen or used; not mandatory or required
