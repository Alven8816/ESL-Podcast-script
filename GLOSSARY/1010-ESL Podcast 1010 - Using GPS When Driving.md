**guide** - a leader; a person who takes a group of people to one or more places,
providing information about them

> The guide said that this is the oldest building west of the Mississippi River.

**GPS** - global positioning system; a navigation system, or an electronic device
that uses that system, that helps people identify where they are

> GPS devices are becoming so popular that I wonder whether anyone will know
how to read a map in a few years.

**to navigate** - to know where one is and identify and follow a safe and efficient
route to one's destination

> The airplane will need to change course to navigate around the air turbulence.

**remote** - distant; far from areas where people live or work

> They own a farm in a remote part of Wyoming.

**satellite** - a manmade device that orbits (travels in a circle) around the Earth,
sending communication and other information between two or more locations on
the planet

> These high-tech phones use satellites to help people communicate in areas
where cell phone networks don't provide coverage.

**current location** - where one is right now

> The taxi drivers are supposed to call the office to report their current location
every 20 minutes.

**to transmit** - to send, especially to send information electronically using
machines

> This sensor transmits information about the patient's heart rate and breathing to
the display monitor.

**receiver** - a device that receives or gets communication from some other
machine or signal

> If the television image isn't clear, try placing the receiver in a more open area.

**to input** - to enter information into a machine; to provide data

> Couldn't we ask the applicants to input their information directly on our website,
rather than having us type up their handwritten applications?

**destination** - where one wants to go; the location one wants to reach

> Our flight has a layover in Dallas, Texas before we arrive at our ultimate
destination, Boulder, Colorado.

**presto** - an informal phrase to announce that something has been done and is
now finished, especially when it was done very quickly and easily

> Just sprinkle some cheese on the soup, slice some bread, and presto! Dinner is
served.

**onscreen** - appearing on a visual electronic display on a television or computer
monitor

> If the picture quality isn't very good onscreen, it probably won't look good as a
printed photo either.

**voice directions** - words spoken by a computer, telling a driver where to turn
and how far to go in order to arrive somewhere

> The voice directions are really easy to follow because the computer is always
patient, even if I make a wrong turn.

**outdated** - with old information that is no longer accurate because something
has changed; no longer fashionable, modern, or current

> Jim has an outdated haircut. He'll have to change it if he wants to look more
fashionable.

**state-of-the-art** - modern, using new technology and processes

> The company created a state-of-the-art gym for employees to use during their
lunch break and after work hours.

**accurate** - with correct information; precise and exact; not wrong

> Are these meter readings accurate? They seem too high.

**a fool with a tool is still a fool** - a phrase used to mean that even the best tools
are useless if the person using them does not have the knowledge or experience
to use it properly

> These smart phones have more computer power than the smartest home
computers from 20 years ago, but most people don't know how to use them. A
fool with a tool is still a fool.
