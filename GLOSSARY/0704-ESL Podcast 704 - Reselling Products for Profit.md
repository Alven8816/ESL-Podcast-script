#### ESL Podcast 704 - Reselling Products for Profit

**to stand in line** - to stand with many other people, one in front of another,
waiting to do or receive something when only one person at a time can do or
receive that thing

> We had to stand in line at the bank for more than 20 minutes. I wish they had
more employees to work with all the customers.

**to go on sale** - to become available for people to buy or to begin to have a lower
sales price

> As soon as the movie tickets go on sale, we're going to buy one for each
member of our family.

**to sell out** - for a store or seller to not have any more of an item because they
have all been sold

> In the days before the big storm, all our local stores sold out of bottled water,
canned food, and flashlights.

**to resell** - to buy something and then sell it again without first using it, usually
because one wants to sell it for more than one paid

> Shayla already has a piano, but she bought a great keyboard for only $20 at a
garage sale and now she's going to try to resell it to make some extra money.

**to scalp tickets** - to buy tickets, especially for a concert or sporting event, at the
standard price and then sell them to individuals at a much higher price

> Some people make thousands of dollars by scalping tickets for the most
popular concerts.

**markup** - an increase in the price when one resells something; the percentage
difference between the price when one buys something and when one sells it

> If we buy these cameras for $50 each and sell them with a 50% markup, our
sales price should be $75.

**profit** - the amount of money one makes from a business activity after paying all
expenses; the difference between one's total revenues (amount of money
received) and total expenses (amount of money paid out)

> Nobody expects the restaurant to make a profit in its first year.

**to jack up the price** - to increase the price of something; to make something
much more expensive than it normally is or than it previously was

> If universities keep jacking up the price of tuition, many young people won't be
able to get a college education.

**to gouge** - to hurt someone by charging a very high price

> When the airport closed and all flights were canceled, hotels could have made
a lot of money by gouging travelers with expensive rooms, but instead they
offered discounted rooms at reasonable prices.

**premium** - extra; an additional amount of money; additional value; something
that makes something better than other versions of the same thing

> The airline offers premium seats with more leg room and better food to first-
class travelers.

**in demand** - desirable; wanted by many people; with many people wanting to
buy or have something

> Computer programmers with experience developing applications for mobile
phones are in demand right now, so they can find jobs easily.

**to be stuck with** - to have something that is undesirable, but that one cannot
get rid of because nobody else wants to have it

> When Helena turned 80, she started getting rid of a lot of her clothes, furniture,
and papers, because she didn't want her kids to be stuck with it after she passed
away.

**to unload (something)** - to be able to sell something; to be able to get rid of
something, usually because other people want to buy it

> The store owners bought too many units of the new product, and unfortunately
they haven't been able to unload them to buyers.

**supply and demand** - the economic theory that prices are set based on the
interactions between the number of people or businesses willing to make and sell
something at a particular price (supply) and the number of people or businesses
willing to buy something at a particular price (demand)

> Supply and demand teaches us that, in most cases, the lower the price of
something is, the more people will want to buy it.

**dough** - money; cash

> How much dough did you have to spend to buy that new car?

**to junk up the market** - to make many extra items available for sale, so that the
price of all those items has to decrease in order for there to be enough people
willing to buy them

> Some people think international trade simply junks up the market with cheap
imports.

**to shoot (oneself) in the foot** - to hurt oneself; to do something stupid or foolish
that has negative consequences for oneself

> When Harvey dropped out of school, he really shot himself in the foot.
