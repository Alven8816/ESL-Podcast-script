#### ESL Podcast 613 - Being a First-Time Parent

**birth** - when a new child is brought into the world; when a baby comes out of his
or her mother's womb and begins breathing on its own

> How many births happen in this hospital each year?

**first-time parent** - a person who has one child, perhaps with plans to have other
children in the future

> As first-time parents, we took our son to the emergency room for every little
cough or scrape, but once we had our second child, we were much calmer.

**overwhelming** - too strong and powerful, making one feel out of control,
confused, and/or powerless

> He says his new job is overwhelming and he has to work 12 hours each day
just to keep up!

**newborn** - a baby that has been born very recently, usually within the past one
to two months

> Newborns are supposed to eat every two hours, but that means the parents
don't get very much sleep.

**from scratch** - from the very beginning, without any initial knowledge or
preparation

> Have you ever made a cake from scratch, or do you always buy a box of pre-
made mix?

**to breastfeed** - for a mother to feed a child with the milk from her breasts; for a
child to drink a mother's milk by sucking at her nipples

> If your baby breastfeeds in the wrong position, you might experience pain or
even bleeding.

**to bottle-feed** - to feed a baby from a bottle (a glass or plastic container with a
special nipple-like top)

> Doctors say it's important to hold a baby close and look into his or her eyes
while bottle-feeding the child.

**to burp** - to gently and repeatedly hit a baby's back after he or she has drunken
milk to help the baby push air that is in the stomach out of his or her mouth

> Always put a cloth over your shoulder before burping the baby, or she might
throw up on you.

**to put (someone) to bed** - to get a baby or child ready for bed and calm him or
her until he or she falls asleep

> Their routine for putting Samson to bed includes brushing his teeth, reading
books, singing songs, and telling stories.

**car seat** - a special chair put inside a car for babies and very young children, to
keep them safe in an accident

> If the car seat is installed correctly, it shouldn't move more than one inch from
side to side.

**stroller** - baby carriage; a small cloth seat on a plastic or metal frame with
wheels, used by walking parents to push a child in front, often with room to store
bags underneath the seat

> Once their daughter learned how to walk, she never wanted to ride in the
stroller again.

**feeding** - one period of time when a baby is drinking milk from a bottle or
nursing (drinking milk from a mother's breast)

> How many feedings does a newborn need each day?

**diaper** - a piece of cloth or paper and plastic that is wrapped around a baby's
bottom to hold urine (pee) and feces (poop)

> It's important to change a baby's diaper frequently so that the skin doesn't
become irritated.

**exhausted** - extremely tired, usually from doing too much physical activity or
from not sleeping enough

**to doze off** - to fall asleep for a short period of time, usually without planning to
do so; to nap

> Professor Graves gets really angry when his students doze off during class.

**to sympathize** - to understand someone else's problems or the difficult situation
that another person is in, feeling sad much like the other person is feeling sad

> I really sympathized with Patty when her mother passed away, because my
mother had passed away just a few months earlier.

**memory** - what one remembers about something that happened in the past

> Do you have any memory of when humans first walked on the moon, or were
you too young then to remember it?
