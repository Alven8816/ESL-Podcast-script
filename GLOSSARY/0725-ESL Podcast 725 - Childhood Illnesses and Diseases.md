their parents are working somewhere else

> Most daycare centers ask parents to leave an extra set of clothing, just in case
the child gets very dirty during the day.

**record year** - the year with the highest level or amount of something; a year with
more of something than ever before

> The years 2009 and 2011 are record years for heat waves in many states.

**chicken pox** - varicella; an infection that is shared easily among children and
also among some adults, causing fever, tiredness, and many small, itchy red
marks on the skin

> Chicken pox is very uncomfortable, but it isn't life-threatening for most children.

**to go around** - for many people to suffer from a disease in a certain area during
a certain period of time, because the disease is easily passed from one person to
another

> The flu has been going around at work lately.

**measles** - rubeola; a viral disease that causes a fever, coughing, runny nose,
red eyes, and many red spots on the skin

> The boy was covered in red spots, but he wasn't scratching them, so the
doctors thought he might have the measles.

**mumps** - a viral disease that causes painful "swelling" (growth; increase in size)
in the "salivary glands" (parts of the body that produce liquid inside the mouth)
near the ears

> When she had the mumps, the sides of her neck swelled so much that she
couldn't really move her head.

**pink eye** - conjunctivitis; a bacterial or viral infection that causes the white part
of the eye to become pink or red, often with clear, yellow or green liquid coming
out of the eye

> You can avoid pink eye by always washing your hands before touching your
eye area.

**nosebleed** - when blood comes out of a person's nose, sometimes for no
apparent reason, usually for only a few minutes

> When Randall was hit in the face with a baseball, it caused a nosebleed.

**earache** - pain inside one's ear caused by an infection

> Do swimmers get earaches more often than non-swimmers?

**contagious** - a disease that is easily passed from one person to another,
perhaps by coughing or sneezing, or by kissing or sharing food or drink

> The nurse told the students that washing their hands with soap and water after
using the bathroom and before eating is a very good way to protect themselves
from contagious diseases.

**disease** - illness; sickness, especially caused by a bacteria or virus

> Did you read about yellow fever and other common diseases before you
decided to travel to that part of the world?

**to take its toll** - to have a negative impact on someone or something; for the
bad effect of something to be noticed

> Years of smoking and sunbathing have taken its toll on Helena's skin.

**strep throat** - a painful bacterial infection that makes one's throat feel scratchy

> Strep throat is much more painful than a regular sore throat.

**croup** - an illness that makes it very hard for young children to breathe and
makes them cough a lot

> When Kenny has croup, his coughing sounded a lot like a dog barking.

**to immunize** - to protect someone from getting a disease by giving them a shot
or having them swallow a liquid that contains a small amount of the virus or
bacteria and makes the body fight against it

> All children must be immunized against polio before they can enter
kindergarten.

**Center for Disease Control** - a U.S. government agency that protects public
health by educating people about health and diseases and by promoting
programs to prevent and fight against diseases

> What is the Center for Disease Control doing about the growing number of
Americans who are overweight or obese?

**gas mask** - a device worn over one's mouth and nose, and sometimes eyes, to
allow one to breathe without being exposed to dangerous chemicals in the air

> Yes, changing a dirty diaper can be a smelly job, but I don't think you really
need a gas mask.
