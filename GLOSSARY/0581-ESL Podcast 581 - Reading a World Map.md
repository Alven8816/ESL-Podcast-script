#### ESL Podcast 581 - Reading a World Map

**map** - a piece of paper with drawings and text showing the location of places

> Noah hung a large world map on his office wall and circled all the places he has
visited.

**globe** - a round ball that rotates in a special stand and represents the world, with
drawings of the continents, oceans, countries, and major cities

> Why does Greenland look so much larger on a map than on a globe?

**postcard** - a small, rectangular piece of paper sent through the mail with a
picture or photograph on one side and a message, address, and stamp on the
other side, used to send brief messages to other people, usually when traveling

> Today we received a postcard that Sebastian sent while he was relaxing on the
beaches of Tahiti.

**adventurous** - looking for adventure and excitement; wanting to do new and
unusual things that most people don't do

> Troy is a really adventurous eater. He's even tried roasted ants, frog legs, and
raw beef.

**compass** - a small, flat, round device with an arrow that always points north, no
matter which way the device is held

> The hikers lost the trail, but they were able to use a compass to find their way
back into town.

**continent** - one of the seven large areas of land: Africa, Antarctica, Asia,
Australia, Europe, North America, and South America

> How many continents have you visited?

**geography** - the study of the earth's surface, especially of the location of natural
features, countries, cities, and the people who live there

> This week, our geography class is focused on African mountains and rivers.

**equator** - an imaginary line around the planet, separating the northern and
southern hemispheres (halves)

> As you move further from the equator, days become longer or shorter
depending on the season.

**latitude** - one of many imaginary lines around the planet, parallel to the equator,
used to talk about how far north or south something is

> Areas at extremely high latitudes have cooler temperatures because they get
less sunlight.

**longitude** - one of many imaginary lines around the planet, perpendicular to the
equator, used to talk about how far east or west something is

> How many miles separate each degree of longitude at the equator?

**sort of** - kind of; somewhat; a little bit; to a certain extent

> Even though it was difficult to spend so much time living with my in-laws, I was
sort of sad when it was time for us to leave their house.

**to make heads or tails of (something)** - to be able to understand something

> I can't make heads or tails of this physics lesson. Do you understand it?

**to scale** - with a constant (unchanging) ratio between the actual distance
between points A and B and the distance between points A and B on a map

> This map is drawn to scale, so one inch represents 10 miles.

**legend** - a small box on a map with words that explains the scale and what
different symbols mean

> According to this legend, a small drawing of a tree represents a park and a
yellow star represents a police station.

**place name** - a word on a map showing what a country, city, or other place is
called

> Almost half the place names on this map are misspelled, and the other half are
in the wrong spot!

**vital statistics** - detailed information, especially information represented in
numbers

> The doctor wrote down all of her patient's vital statistics in the patient's official
file.
