#### ESL Podcast 804 - Dealing with Time Changes in Scheduling

**don't bother** - a phrase used to tell someone not to do something, because it
will not be successful, it is not possible, or it will not be helpful

> Don't bother asking Jenna for help with the calculations. She doesn't know how
to do them either.

**calendar** - a record of times, days, weeks, and years, used for showing what will
happen and what one must do at certain times in the future

> I think I'm free for a meeting next Tuesday, but let me check my calendar.

**to throw off** - to confuse or mislead someone, making it difficult or impossible
for him or her to do or understand something

> The flight cancellation threw off their vacation plans.

**to keep in mind** - to remember; to be aware of something, often while doing
something else

> Keep in mind that most new restaurants fail within the first few years.

**bylaws** - official rules created by an organization that describes how it will
function and be governed

> According to the bylaws, we should have at least eight people on the board of
directors.

**leap year** - a year that has 366 days and comes once every four years; a year
that includes February 29th

> Keith was born on February 29th
, so he celebrates his birthday only during leap
years and he likes to joke that he's only seven years old, even though he's really
28.

**to take (something) into account** - to include or consider something in one's
decision or opinion

> New cell phones seem really cheap, but once you take into account the monthly
service fees, they can be quite expensive.

**daylight saving time** - a system of time that moves clocks ahead or back one
hour twice a year to give people more hours of light in the evening

> Some people say that daylight saving time improves health, because it
encourages people to spend more time outdoors after work.

**to set ahead** - to move one's clock forward a certain amount of time, so that the
time displayed on the clock becomes later

> I hate setting clocks ahead at night, because it means waking up an hour earlier
the next morning.

**to set back** - to move one's clock backward a certain amount of time, so that the
time displayed on the clock becomes earlier

> Larion forgot to set back his watch, so he ended up arriving at the 3:00 meeting
an hour early, when it was actually 2:00.

**fall back and spring ahead** - a phrase used to help people remember to set
their clocks back one hour in the fall (autumn) and to set their clocks forward one
hour in the spring, which is easier to remember because "to fall back" means to
begin to walk more slowly behind a group of people, and "to spring ahead"
means to jump or hurry and be in front of a group of people

> I know the phrase is "fall back and spring ahead," but that doesn't help me
remember on which day I'm supposed to change the clocks.

already done

you can find typed copies online.

**to fudge** - to fake one's answer or result, altering an amount in some way,
presenting one's guess as a real answer, or telling a small lie
