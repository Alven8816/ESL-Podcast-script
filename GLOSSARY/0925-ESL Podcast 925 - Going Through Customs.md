#### ESL Podcast 925 - Going Through Customs

**passport** - an official government document that allows one to travel
internationally, with pages for stamps each time one enters or exits a country

> Do Americans need to have a passport to travel to Canada?

**final destination** - the place where one is going, not the one or more stops on
one's journey

> Our final destination is Madison, Wisconsin, but first we have to change planes
in Houston, Texas.

**stay** - the period of time when one is in a particular place, especially during a
vacation or a business trip

> How long was your stay in the resort?

**on business** - traveling for work, not for pleasure

> Rick is traveling on business, but he will reply to your email once he's back in
the office later this week.

**to accompany (someone)** - to go with someone; to provide companionship to
someone; to do something with another person

> In some countries, women are not allowed to be in public unless they are
accompanied by a male relative.

**on vacation** - traveling for pleasure, relaxation, and enjoyment, not for work

> We both gained a lot of weight while on vacation, because we ate in restaurants
every day.

**restricted items** - things that are not allowed, or that have limitations or rules

> Knives, scissors, aerosol cans, and fireworks are all restricted items on
airplanes.

**to declare** - to make an official statement, especially to let a customs official
know that one is carrying something of interest while traveling

> Why do we have to declare how much money we're bringing into the country?

**duty-free** - without taxes being included in the price of things one buys

> A lot of people on the flight purchased duty-free alcohol and cigarettes.

**to step over** - to move to the side; to go in a particular direction

> Please step over here, sir, and let me show you some of our best luxury
watches.

**exam station** - a large table or a small area where people can thoroughly
examine something, especially a place where people review the items inside
suitcases in an airport

> Tomio works in an exam station at the airport, and he has some interesting
stories about the crazy things some people pack when they travel internationally.

**baggage inspection** - the process of opening a suitcase and reviewing all the
items inside it to determine whether people are carrying things that are not
allowed

> Dogs that can smell illegal drugs are an important part of baggage inspections
at the airport.

**to confiscate** - to use one's authority to take something from a person against
that person's wishes

> If you take knitting needles on an airplane, the flight attendant might confiscate
them so you can't use them as a weapon.

**to get off scot-free** - to not receive any punishment for one's bad behavior; to
break the rules without any negative consequences

> If that criminal gets off scot-free, it's a clear sign that our justice system isn't
working.

**to smuggle (something) in** - to bring something that is not allowed under the
laws or rules, especially when crossing international borders

> Sometimes people smuggle in drugs by swallowing small plastic bags filled with
cocaine.
