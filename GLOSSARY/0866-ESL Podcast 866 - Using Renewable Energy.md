#### ESL Podcast 866 - Using Renewable Energy

**invention** - something that one has created, that nobody else has made before,
usually to fill some need or with some special purpose, especially with hopes that
it can be sold

> Somebody needs to come up with an invention that will fold and put away the
laundry automatically!

**energy source** - a way of obtaining or getting the energy needed to power or
operate machines

> Someday we will run out of oil, so we need to find alternative energy sources.

**renewable energy** - energy that comes from natural resources that cannot be
depleted (cannot run out), like sun, wind, and water

> Many people say they care about the environment, but how many of them are
willing to pay more for renewable energy?

**to recycle** - to take a used item and break it into its components (parts or
pieces) so that they can be used to make a new item again

> In most cities, people can recycle plastic containers, but not the lids.

**fuel** - something that is burned to produce energy to power machines

> Do those trains run on diesel or some other kind of fuel?

**the wave of the future** - something that will become very popular and
commonplace or normal in the future

> Working from home and connecting to the office online is the wave of the
future.

**efficient** - doing something well with a small amount of time, money, or other
resources

> We could make our factory more efficient if we found a way to use the heat that
the machines generate to keep the buildings warm in the wintertime.

**wind power** - a way to create energy by using the natural wind to move large
pieces of metal in a circle to produce energy

> Wind power is great for the environment, but many people complain about the
way an area looks once it is covered in wind turbines.

**solar energy** - a way to create energy by using large, flat panels to collect
energy from sunlight

> The Lopez family put special panels on their roof so that they can use solar
energy to heat their water.

**geothermal** - related to a way of getting energy by accessing the very hot area
inside the planet, underground

> Geothermal heat is a good energy source, because it does not create any
pollution.

**hydroelectric power plant** - a construction that produces energy by having a
large wall (dam) that holds back a lot of water, and that lets a small amount of
water flow through at specific times when it is used to turn turbines that produce
electricity

> How do hydroelectric power plants make sure that salmon and other types of
fish are able to swim on the rivers without being killed by the dams?

**to waste** - to not use something fully; to throw away or destroy something that
could have been used by others for a particular purpose

> If you turn off the water while brushing your teeth, you can avoid wasting so
much water.

**I hate to break it to you** - a phrase used when delivering bad news, used to
show that one does not want to disappoint someone or hurt his or her feelings

> I know you've been working really hard on these math problems, so I hate to
break it to you, but the assignment was actually to do the problems on the next
page.

**to convert** - to transform; to change something from one thing into another

> How can I convert a weight from pounds to kilos?

**biofuel** - a fuel (something that can be burned to produce energy) that is made
from organic (plants and animals) substances

> How much of corn grown in the United States is used for biofuel versus food?

**to beat (someone) to the punch** - to do something before another person has
an opportunity to do it

> Henrietta wanted to suggest a change to the company's policy on paid
vacations, but one of her co-workers beat her to the punch.

**stench** - a very bad smell; a very unpleasant smell

> There's always a stench around that pig farm.
