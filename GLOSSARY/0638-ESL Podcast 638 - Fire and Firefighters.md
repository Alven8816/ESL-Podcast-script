#### ESL Podcast 638 - Fire and Firefighters

**smoke** - the smelly gray or black air that appears when something is burning;
the dark gas that comes from a fire

> It was really rude when Boyce blew smoke in his father's face.

**story** - a floor or level in a building

> This skyscraper is more than 50 stories tall.

**fire alarm** - a loud sound and/or bright flashing light used to let people know that
there is a fire in the building and they should leave

> When the school tests its fire alarm, students leave their classroom with their
teacher while the administrators see how long it takes to get everyone out of the
building.

**to go off** - for an alarm to begin making noise

> Bernice's alarm clock goes off at 5:45 a.m. each morning so that she can get
ready for work.

**fire station** - a large building that houses people and equipment for putting out
fires

> The nearest fire station is more than one hour's drive away, so if there's a fire
here, we'll probably have to put it out ourselves.

**fire engine** - fire truck; a large red or yellow truck that carries hoses, ladders,
and other equipment for putting out fires

> If you see a fire engine with its lights on, you should pull over and let it drive by
quickly.

**firefighter** - a person whose job is to put out fires

> Firefighters come from all over the state to fight the large forest fires each
summer.

**blaze** - a large flame; a fire, especially a big and dangerous one

> The investigators think the blaze started with an electrical problem.

**fire extinguisher** - a metal container that is held in one's hands and sprays out
chemicals to put out a fire

> It's a good idea to keep a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, just in case there's a
fire.

**ladder** - a piece of equipment that allows a person to climb high, with two long
pieces of metal or wood and many shorter pieces of metal or wood between
them, leaned against a wall to be almost like a staircase

> They used a ladder to reach that kitten that got stuck high up in the tree.

**fire hose** - a long, flexible fabric or plastic tube that carries water from one place
to another, used to put out fires

> That fire hose is so heavy that at least three strong firemen are needed to carry
it.

**hydrant** - a large piece of metal, usually painted red, orange, or yellow, placed
on the side of the street and connected to water pipes under the street, so that
firefighters can connect a fire hose to it and have water to put out a fire

> It's illegal to park in front of a fire hydrant, because you car might make it
impossible for firefighters to get the water they need to put out a fire.

**false alarm** - a situation where people believe there is a problem, but actually
everything is fine

> We thought Anita was having a heart attack, but the doctors said it was a false
alarm and she was just experiencing stomach problems.

**smoke detector** - a device that makes a loud sound when smoke is in the air,
letting people know there is a fire somewhere

> The smoke detector in the kitchen goes off almost every time Kirby cooks,
because he burns everything!

**to burn** - to be consumed by fire; to be damaged or destroyed by fire; to be in
flames

> Tyler and his wife cried as they watched their house burn.

**ashes** - the grey or black powder that is left after something has burned

> If you light a fire in the fireplace, be sure to clean up all the ashes.

**to have a fascination with (something)** - to be very interested in something; to
spend a lot of time thinking about something

> Bud has always had a fascination with outer space, so it was easy for him to
decide to study astronomy in college.

**to light up** - to put a small fire at the end of a cigar or cigarette so that one can
smoke it

> Please don't light up around the baby. The smoke isn't good for her.
