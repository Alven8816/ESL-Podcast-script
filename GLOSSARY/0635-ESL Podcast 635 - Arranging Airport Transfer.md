#### ESL Podcast 635 - Arranging Airport Transfer

**vacation package** - an arrangement that includes airfare, lodging,
transportation, admission fees, and possibly food and drink so that one can enjoy
a vacation without worrying about the details, usually for one price

> This five-day vacation package includes everything except alcohol.

**to double-check** - to make sure something is a certain way, often by asking
more than once

> I know I just asked this question a few moments ago, but I want to double-
check: Are you sure there won't be any hidden fees on our bill?

**airport transfer** - transportation from the airport to one's hotel or other
destination

> They've arranged our airport transfer - we just need to look for a man holding
up a sign with our name once we get off the plane.

**hindsight is 20/20** - a phrase used to express the idea that one cannot
understand something fully until after it has happened, and it is impossible to
have that information before it happens

> If we'd known that everyone here would be wearing tuxedos and formal
dresses, we would have dressed better, but hindsight is 20/20.

**taxi** - a car with a driver who is paid to take different people to different locations

> Let's take a taxi to the next meeting because it will be hard to find parking if we
drive there.

**to nix** - to not let something happen; to say no; to deny or refuse something

> They were planning an outdoor wedding, but they had to nix that idea when it
began to rain heavily.

**to cost an arm and a leg** - to be very expensive; to be very costly

> Adding another bedroom to your home is going to cost an arm and a leg. Are
you sure you don't just want to move to a bigger house?

**option** - one of many choices; one of many things that one can have or do

> The cable company offers three payment options: cash, credit card, or check.

**limo service** - a company that arranges to drive people from one place to
another in a limousine (a very fancy, expensive, and long black car)

> If you really want to impress your date, pick her up using a limo service.

**to be out** - to not be an option; to be impossible; to be eliminated as a choice

> Peter is afraid of heights so flying across the country is out. We have to drive
or take a bus.

**shuttle service** - a company that arranges to drive groups of people from one
place to another, usually in a large van, normally going to and from the same
places every day

> This airport shuttle service will pick you up from your home and take you to the
airport, but it takes a while because you'll have to wait while the driver picks up
other people, too.

**stop** - one of many places where a vehicle pauses for a short period of time to
let people on or off

> Do you live near a bus stop?

**public transportation** - types of vehicles that are provided by a city for
everyone to use, usually after paying a small fee, such as buses, subways, or
trams

> If everyone used public transportation, there would be less traffic in this city.

**bus** - a large vehicle that has many seats and follows the same route each day,
or many times in a day, taking people to and from different places

> Taking the bus to work is kind of slow, but I enjoy being able to read the
newspaper instead of driving.

**subway** - a type of train that moves underground, taking people from one place
to another quickly in large cities

> Max rides the subway to work each morning, transferring from the yellow line to
the red line.

**courtesy shuttle** - a large van operated by a hotel that moves people between
the airport and the hotel whenever they need it, for free

> I've reserved one room with a queen-sized bed for two nights, and the hotel is
going to send its courtesy shuttle to meet us at the airport.

**on its way** - coming toward oneself; in movement, but not yet at the destination

> Your package was mailed last Thursday, so it is on its way and should arrive
within the next day or two.

**to relish** - to enjoy; to look forward to

> I don't relish the thought of our daughter moving so far away, but I know it's a
good career opportunity for her.

**red-eye** - an airplane flight that travels during the night-time hours

> Sandra could have saved money by taking the red-eye flight, but she decided
she didn't want to be so tired when she arrives.
